# VESPA Activities v2 - Handover Document

## Project Overview
The VESPA Activities application is a Knack-based student portal that recommends and manages learning activities based on VESPA scores (Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, Attitude). The app provides personalized activity suggestions, allows students to add custom activities, and tracks their progress.

## Current Working Files
- **Main Application**: `student/VESPAactivitiesStudent4h.js` (6357 lines)
- **Styles**: `student/VESPAactivitiesStudent4h.css` (5216 lines)
- **Data Mappings**: `shared/vespa-problem-activity-mappings1a.json`

## Completed Work Summary

### 1. Fixed Activity Saving Functionality âœ…
**Problem**: Activities couldn't be saved to the dashboard (field_1683 - prescribedActivities)
**Solution**: 
- Corrected API authentication using proper Knack REST API credentials
- Fixed API endpoints to use direct Knack API URLs
- Added proper Content-Type headers and JSON.stringify() for data
- Implemented auto-refresh after save operations (500ms delay)

### 2. Enhanced Welcome Modal System âœ…
**Features Implemented**:
- **New User Detection**: Using field_3655 (newUser flag) with proper boolean handling
- **Three Modal Types**:
  1. Comprehensive welcome for new users
  2. Motivational modals for returning users
  3. Cycle change notifications
- **Visual Improvements**:
  - Opaque backdrop (60% black with blur)
  - Smart Activity Suggestions spans full width with larger text
  - "How It Works" section in 2x2 grid layout
  - Responsive design for mobile

### 3. Redesigned Wizard Start Page âœ…
**Changes Made**:
- Header: "Let's Review Your VESPA Scores"
- Chart emoji (ðŸ“Š) instead of waving hand
- Clear description of score purpose
- Scores embedded inside progress bars
- Score interpretation guide (1-3: Focus, 4-6: Developing, 7-10: Strong)
- Updated button text for clarity

### 4. Fixed Student Name Recognition âœ…
**Solution**:
- Checks multiple sources in order:
  1. VESPA scores record (field_187 from view_3164)
  2. Student record (field_1875)
  3. Knack user attributes
- Handles both object and string name formats

### 5. Add Activity Features âœ…
- "+" button on activity cards in category modals
- Auto-refresh after adding/removing activities
- Shows all 7 problems per category (not limited to 3)

## Technical Architecture

### Key Knack Objects & Fields
```javascript
// Student Record
studentId: 'field_1274'        // Student ID
prescribedActivities: 'field_1683'  // Connected field (many-to-many)
newUser: 'field_3655'          // Boolean flag
currentCycle: 'field_1686'     // Current cycle number
studentName: 'field_1875'      // Student name

// VESPA Scores (view_3164)
vespaScores: {
    vision: 'field_1279',
    effort: 'field_1280',
    systems: 'field_1281',
    practice: 'field_1282',
    attitude: 'field_1283'
}
field_187: // Alternative name field location

// Activity Object (object_44)
activityRecordId: // Record ID
field_1278: // Activity name (connection field)
```

### API Authentication
```javascript
const knackAppId = '66e26296d863e5001c6f1e09';
const knackApiKey = '0b19dcb0-9f43-11ef-8724-eb3bc75b770f';

// Headers for API calls
headers: {
    'X-Knack-Application-Id': knackAppId,
    'X-Knack-REST-API-Key': knackApiKey,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

### Core Functions
- `parseStudentRecord()`: Extracts student data from Knack views
- `makeAuthenticatedKnackCall()`: Handles API requests with proper auth
- `addActivityToDashboard()`: Adds activity to student's prescribed list
- `removeActivityFromDashboard()`: Removes activity from list
- `showWelcomeJourney()`: Multi-step wizard for activity selection
- `showNewUserWelcome()`: Comprehensive welcome modal
- `showMotivationalModal()`: Quick motivational messages
- `showCycleChangeModal()`: Notifies about new cycle

## Current State

### What's Working
- âœ… Activity saving/removing with auto-refresh
- âœ… New user detection and differentiated modals
- âœ… Cycle change detection
- âœ… Student name recognition from multiple sources
- âœ… Wizard with redesigned start page
- âœ… Add activity buttons on category cards
- âœ… Responsive design for all modals

### Known Issues/Limitations
1. Modal backdrop sometimes needs manual CSS adjustment
2. Student name may not appear if not in any expected fields
3. Refresh delay (500ms) might still feel slow to some users

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Test thoroughly** with different user types (new/returning)
2. **Monitor** API call success rates in production
3. **Verify** student name appears correctly for all users

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance**:
   - Consider optimistic UI updates instead of page refresh
   - Implement loading states during API calls

2. **User Experience**:
   - Add activity completion tracking
   - Implement progress indicators for activities
   - Add activity filtering/search in dashboard

3. **Data & Analytics**:
   - Track which activities are most added/removed
   - Monitor user engagement with different modal types
   - Analyze completion rates for suggested vs custom activities

4. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Move API credentials to environment variables
   - Implement error retry logic for failed API calls
   - Add comprehensive error logging

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] New user sees comprehensive welcome modal
- [ ] Returning user sees motivational modal
- [ ] Cycle change triggers appropriate modal
- [ ] Activities can be added from wizard
- [ ] Activities can be added from category modals
- [ ] Activities can be removed from dashboard
- [ ] Auto-refresh works after all operations
- [ ] Student name displays correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works

## File Version History
- `VESPAactivitiesStudent4a-4g`: Previous iterations (deleted)
- `VESPAactivitiesStudent4h`: Current production version

## Important Notes
1. **Authentication**: The app uses REST API keys, not user tokens
2. **Refresh Strategy**: Full page reload after changes (not ideal but reliable)
3. **Modal Logic**: Based on `newUser` flag and `lastSeenCycle` in localStorage
4. **Data Flow**: Student data comes from multiple Knack views (view_3168, view_3164, view_3165)

## Contact & Resources
- Knack Application ID: `66e26296d863e5001c6f1e09`
- Primary Object: `object_39` (Students)
- Activity Object: `object_44` (Activities)
- Problem Mappings: `vespa-problem-activity-mappings1a.json`
