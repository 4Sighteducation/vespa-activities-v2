# VESPA Activities Staff Management System - Handover Document
**Date:** January 2025
**Current Version:** VESPAactivitiesStaff1l.js / VESPAactivitiesStaff1l.css
**Last Updated:** January 2025 - Fixed critical filtering bug, added pagination

## üéØ Project Overview
The VESPA Activities Staff Management System is a Knack-based interface for staff members (Tutors, Head of Years, Subject Teachers, Staff Admins) to manage student activities, track progress, and provide feedback.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUG FIX (January 2025)
**Issue:** Staff admins were seeing ALL students in the system instead of just their assigned students
**Fix:** Added proper filtering using field_190 (studentStaffAdmins) for staff admin role
**Impact:** Staff admins now correctly see only their assigned students

## üîß Recent Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented:
1. **Role-Based Access**
   - Detects user roles from Knack profiles (profile_7 = Tutor, etc.)
   - Fetches actual role records to get IDs for filtering
   - Filters students based on staff-student connections
   - **FIXED:** Staff admins now properly filtered

2. **Student Data Loading**
   - Loads students correctly for all role types
   - Parses student names and emails from nested field structures
   - Calculates progress based on prescribed/completed activities
   - **NEW:** Pagination for large datasets (50 students initial load for staff admins)

3. **VESPA Scores Integration**
   - Fixed API filter format (changed from "is any" to OR conditions)
   - Maps scores to students by ID
   - Added extensive logging for debugging field mappings

4. **Enhanced UI Components**
   - Student table with progress bars
   - Modal for viewing student details with activity questions
   - Tabbed interface for completed/incomplete activities
   - Activity cards with VESPA category colors
   - Re-assign functionality for completed activities
   - Feedback system (API integration ready)
   - **NEW:** Load More button for pagination
   - **NEW:** Shows "X of Y total students" count
   - **NEW:** Activity preview with questions
   - **NEW:** Enhanced activity details (description, duration, type)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues to Verify:

1. **VESPA Scores Field Mapping**
   - Check console logs for actual field values
   - May need to update field numbers (147-151) based on API response

2. **Activity Questions Field Mapping**
   - Verify field_1136 is correct for activity connection in object_45
   - Check field_1137 (question), field_1138 (type), field_1139 (options)

## üìä Key Knack Objects & Fields

### Objects:
- `object_3` - Accounts (Users)
- `object_5` - Staff Admin
- `object_6` - Student
- `object_7` - Tutor
- `object_10` - VESPA Results
- `object_18` - Head of Year
- `object_44` - Activities
- `object_45` - Activity Questions
- `object_46` - Activity Answers
- `object_78` - Subject Teacher
- `object_126` - Activity Progress
- `object_127` - Student Achievements
- `object_128` - Activity Feedback

### Critical Field Mappings:
```javascript
// Student fields (Object_6)
studentName: 'field_90',        // Returns {first, last, full}
studentEmail: 'field_91',       // Returns {email, label}
prescribedActivities: 'field_1683',
finishedActivities: 'field_1380',

// Staff connection fields (many-to-many)
studentTutors: 'field_1682',    // Contains Tutor IDs
studentHeadsOfYear: 'field_547',
studentSubjectTeachers: 'field_2177',
studentStaffAdmins: 'field_190', // CRITICAL for staff admin filtering

// VESPA scores (Object_10)
visionScore: 'field_147',
effortScore: 'field_148',
systemsScore: 'field_149',
practiceScore: 'field_150',
attitudeScore: 'field_151',
studentConnection: 'field_163'  // Links to Student

// Activity fields (Object_44)
activityName: 'field_1278',
activityVESPACategory: 'field_1285',
activityLevel: 'field_1295',
activityDescription: 'field_1134',
activityDuration: 'field_1135',
activityType: 'field_1133',

// Activity Questions (Object_45)
questionActivity: 'field_1136',  // Connection to activity
questionText: 'field_1137',
questionType: 'field_1138',
questionOptions: 'field_1139',
questionOrder: 'field_1140'
```

## üêõ Debugging Steps

### To Debug VESPA Scores:
1. Check console for "VESPA scores response" log
2. Look for "VESPA record fields:" to see actual field names
3. Verify scores are in fields 147-151 or adjust accordingly

### To Debug Activity Questions:
1. Check "Loading questions for activity:" logs
2. Verify connection field and question fields
3. Test with known activity IDs

## üîç Key Code Sections

### Pagination Implementation (NEW):
```javascript
// Line ~153: Added pagination state
pagination: {
    currentPage: 1,
    totalPages: 1,
    totalRecords: 0,
    hasMore: false
}

// Line ~500: Dynamic load size
const initialLoadSize = isStaffAdmin ? 50 : 200;

// Line ~1995: loadMoreStudents() method
```

### Fixed Staff Admin Filter (Line ~447):
```javascript
case 'staffAdmin':
    // Staff admins should only see their assigned students
    if (roleId && roleId !== 'test_id') {
        filters.push({
            field: fields.studentStaffAdmins,
            operator: 'contains',
            value: roleId
        });
    }
```

### Enhanced Activity Loading (Line ~987):
```javascript
// Added fields for description, duration, type
const description = this.getFieldValue(record, 'field_1134', '');
const duration = this.getFieldValue(record, 'field_1135', '');
const type = this.getFieldValue(record, 'field_1133', '');
```

## üìù Testing Checklist

1. **Role-Based Access**
   - [ ] Login as staff admin - verify only assigned students show
   - [ ] Login as tutor - verify only tutees show
   - [ ] Switch between roles if user has multiple

2. **Pagination**
   - [ ] Initial load shows 50 students for staff admin
   - [ ] "Load More" button works correctly
   - [ ] Student count shows "X of Y total"
   - [ ] Filters persist when loading more

3. **VESPA Scores**
   - [ ] Check console for score values
   - [ ] Verify scores display correctly (not all 0s)
   - [ ] Update field mappings if needed

4. **Activity Features**
   - [ ] "Preview Activity" shows questions
   - [ ] "View Response" shows student answers
   - [ ] Activity descriptions and durations display

## üí° Performance Considerations

For large colleges (2000+ students):
1. Initial load limited to 50 students
2. Load more on demand
3. Consider implementing search-first approach
4. See LARGE_DATASET_STRATEGY.md for advanced options

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Upload updated files to CDN:
   - VESPAactivitiesStaff1l.js
   - VESPAactivitiesStaff1l.css

2. Clear CDN cache if necessary

3. Test with different user roles

4. Monitor console logs for field mapping issues

## üîë Critical Notes

1. **Never remove the staff admin filter** - it prevents data leakage
2. **Role IDs are critical** - system uses record IDs, not emails
3. **Pagination is essential** for large datasets
4. **Field mappings may vary** between Knack instances

## üìå Next Steps

1. Verify VESPA score field mappings with live data
2. Test with real staff admin account (2000+ students)
3. Implement search functionality for large datasets
4. Add export capability for bulk operations
5. Consider virtual scrolling for extreme cases (5000+ students)
