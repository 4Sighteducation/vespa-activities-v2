# VESPA Activities Staff Management System - Handover Document
**Date:** January 2025
**Current Version:** VESPAactivitiesStaff1m.js / VESPAactivitiesStaff1m.css
**Last Updated:** January 2025 - Fixed staff admin filtering, VESPA scores connection, activity rendering

## üéØ Project Overview
The VESPA Activities Staff Management System is a Knack-based interface for staff members (Tutors, Head of Years, Subject Teachers, Staff Admins) to manage student activities, track progress, and provide feedback.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUG FIXES (January 2025)

### 1. Staff Admin Filtering
**Issue:** Staff admins were seeing ALL students in the system instead of just their assigned students
**Fix:** Added proper filtering using field_190 (studentStaffAdmins) for staff admin role
**Impact:** Staff admins now correctly see only their assigned students

### 2. VESPA Scores Connection
**Issue:** VESPA scores were not loading due to incorrect field mapping
**Fix:** Updated to use field_182 (studentVESPAConnection) which holds the ID/email of connected Object_10 record
**Impact:** VESPA scores now load correctly using the proper connection field

### 3. Activities Not Showing
**Issue:** Activities were not rendering in the student details modal
**Fix:** Updated activity parsing to handle HTML connection spans and improved activity card rendering
**Impact:** Activities now display as interactive cards with questions and student responses

## üîß Recent Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented:
1. **Role-Based Access**
   - Detects user roles from Knack profiles (profile_7 = Tutor, etc.)
   - Fetches actual role records to get IDs for filtering
   - Filters students based on staff-student connections
   - **FIXED:** Staff admins now properly filtered

2. **Student Data Loading**
   - Loads students correctly for all role types
   - Parses student names and emails from nested field structures
   - Calculates progress based on prescribed/completed activities
   - **NEW:** Pagination for large datasets (50 students initial load for staff admins)

3. **VESPA Scores Integration**
   - Fixed API filter format (changed from "is any" to OR conditions)
   - Maps scores to students by ID
   - Added extensive logging for debugging field mappings

4. **Enhanced UI Components**
   - Student table with progress bars
   - Modal for viewing student details with activity questions
   - Tabbed interface for completed/incomplete activities
   - Activity cards with VESPA category colors
   - Re-assign functionality for completed activities
   - Feedback system (API integration ready)
   - **NEW:** Load More button for pagination
   - **NEW:** Shows "X of Y total students" count
   - **NEW:** Activity preview with questions
   - **NEW:** Enhanced activity details (description, duration, type)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues to Verify:

1. **VESPA Scores Field Mapping**
   - Check console logs for actual field values
   - May need to update field numbers (147-151) based on API response

2. **Activity Questions Field Mapping**
   - Verify field_1136 is correct for activity connection in object_45
   - Check field_1137 (question), field_1138 (type), field_1139 (options)

## üìä Key Knack Objects & Fields

### Objects:
- `object_3` - Accounts (Users)
- `object_5` - Staff Admin
- `object_6` - Student
- `object_7` - Tutor
- `object_10` - VESPA Results
- `object_18` - Head of Year
- `object_44` - Activities
- `object_45` - Activity Questions
- `object_46` - Activity Answers
- `object_78` - Subject Teacher
- `object_126` - Activity Progress
- `object_127` - Student Achievements
- `object_128` - Activity Feedback

### Critical Field Mappings:
```javascript
// Student fields (Object_6)
studentName: 'field_90',        // Returns {first, last, full}
studentEmail: 'field_91',       // Returns {email, label}
prescribedActivities: 'field_1683',  // HTML spans with activity names
finishedActivities: 'field_1380',    // HTML spans with activity names
studentVESPAConnection: 'field_182',  // ID/email of connected Object_10 record

// Staff connection fields (many-to-many)
studentTutors: 'field_1682',    // Contains Tutor IDs
studentHeadsOfYear: 'field_547',
studentSubjectTeachers: 'field_2177',
studentStaffAdmins: 'field_190', // CRITICAL for staff admin filtering

// VESPA scores (Object_10)
visionScore: 'field_147',
effortScore: 'field_148',
systemsScore: 'field_149',
practiceScore: 'field_150',
attitudeScore: 'field_151'

// Activity fields (Object_44)
activityName: 'field_1278',
activityVESPACategory: 'field_1285',
activityLevel: 'field_1295',
activityDescription: 'field_1134',
activityDuration: 'field_1135',
activityType: 'field_1133',

// Activity Questions (Object_45)
questionActivity: 'field_1136',  // Connection to activity
questionText: 'field_1137',
questionType: 'field_1138',
questionOptions: 'field_1139',
questionOrder: 'field_1140'
```

## üêõ Debugging Steps

### To Debug VESPA Scores:
1. Check console for "VESPA scores response" log
2. Look for "VESPA record fields:" to see actual field names
3. Verify scores are in fields 147-151 or adjust accordingly

### To Debug Activity Questions:
1. Check "Loading questions for activity:" logs
2. Verify connection field and question fields
3. Test with known activity IDs

## üîç Key Code Sections

### Pagination Implementation (NEW):
```javascript
// Line ~153: Added pagination state
pagination: {
    currentPage: 1,
    totalPages: 1,
    totalRecords: 0,
    hasMore: false
}

// Line ~500: Dynamic load size
const initialLoadSize = isStaffAdmin ? 50 : 200;

// Line ~1995: loadMoreStudents() method
```

### Fixed Staff Admin Filter (Line ~447):
```javascript
case 'staffAdmin':
    // Staff admins should only see their assigned students
    if (roleId && roleId !== 'test_id') {
        filters.push({
            field: fields.studentStaffAdmins,
            operator: 'contains',
            value: roleId
        });
    }
```

### Enhanced Activity Loading (Line ~987):
```javascript
// Added fields for description, duration, type
const description = this.getFieldValue(record, 'field_1134', '');
const duration = this.getFieldValue(record, 'field_1135', '');
const type = this.getFieldValue(record, 'field_1133', '');
```

## üìù Testing Checklist

1. **Role-Based Access**
   - [ ] Login as staff admin - verify only assigned students show
   - [ ] Login as tutor - verify only tutees show
   - [ ] Switch between roles if user has multiple

2. **Pagination**
   - [ ] Initial load shows 50 students for staff admin
   - [ ] "Load More" button works correctly
   - [ ] Student count shows "X of Y total"
   - [ ] Filters persist when loading more

3. **VESPA Scores**
   - [ ] Check console for score values
   - [ ] Verify scores display correctly (not all 0s)
   - [ ] Update field mappings if needed

4. **Activity Features**
   - [ ] "Preview Activity" shows questions
   - [ ] "View Response" shows student answers
   - [ ] Activity descriptions and durations display

## üí° Performance Considerations

For large colleges (2000+ students):
1. Initial load limited to 50 students
2. Load more on demand
3. Consider implementing search-first approach
4. See LARGE_DATASET_STRATEGY.md for advanced options

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Upload updated files to CDN:
   - VESPAactivitiesStaff1l.js
   - VESPAactivitiesStaff1l.css

2. Clear CDN cache if necessary

3. Test with different user roles

4. Monitor console logs for field mapping issues

## üîë Critical Notes

1. **Never remove the staff admin filter** - it prevents data leakage
2. **Role IDs are critical** - system uses record IDs, not emails
3. **Pagination is essential** for large datasets
4. **Field mappings may vary** between Knack instances

## üìå Next Steps

## 2f/2g Update ‚Äì Staff Activities (Latest)

This section documents the most recent changes made in versions 2f/2g of the staff app.

### Views (Staff Page)
- Container (inject app): `view_3179`
- Activities (Object_44): `view_3178`
- Activity Answers (Object_46): `view_3177`
- Student role-scoped views (Object_6):
  - Staff Admin: `view_3192`
  - Tutor: `view_3193`
  - Head of Year: `view_3194`
  - Subject Teacher: `view_3195`

All of the above are hidden immediately on page load to prevent UI flash. The rich text view (`view_3179`) is the only visible container.

### Objects & Critical Field Mappings (recap)
- Object_6 (Student)
  - Prescribed/All Activities connection: `field_1683`
  - Finished Activities (CSV of activity IDs, no spaces): `field_1380`
  - New optional fields (not required for origin):
    - Staff Added Activities: `field_3581` (CSV)
    - Staff Added Date/Time: `field_3583` (dd/mm/yyyy)
    - Student Added Activities: `field_3580` (CSV)
    - Student Added Date/Time: `field_3582`

- Object_44 (Activities)
  - Name: `field_1278`, Category: `field_1285`, Level (preferred): `field_3568`, Thresholds: `field_1287`/`field_1294`

- Object_45 (Activity Questions)
  - Connection to Activity (by name): `field_1286`
  - Text/Type/Options/Order: `field_1137`/`field_1138`/`field_1139`/`field_1140`

- Object_46 (Activity Answers)
  - Activity JSON (raw): `field_1300`
  - Activity connection: `field_1302` (use `_raw[0].id` when available)

- Object_126 (Activity Progress)
  - Student: `field_3536`, Activity: `field_3537`
  - Dates: `field_3539/3540/3541` (assigned/started/completed)
  - Status: `field_3543`
  - Selected Via (origin): `field_3546`

### Origin of Activities (Badges)
We now standardize ‚Äúorigin‚Äù in the Activity Progress object (`object_126.field_3546`).
- Student app writes `selectedVia = 'student_choice'` when a student starts an activity.
- Staff app writes `selectedVia = 'staff_assigned'` when assigning an activity.
- Prescribed is inferred by membership of `student.prescribedActivityIds` (threshold logic is not written to progress).

Badges rendered on cards:
- Prescribed: teal chip `badge-prescribed`
- Staff Added: purple chip `badge-staff` (latest progress `selected_via === 'staff_assigned'`)
- Self Selected: blue chip `badge-self` (not prescribed and not staff-assigned)
- Completed: grey chip `badge-completed` + card greyscale

### Assignment Flow (Staff UI)
When a staff member assigns activities:
1) Update `Object_6.field_1683` with the assigned activity IDs (connection update, IDs only)
2) Create a Progress record (Object_126) per student+activity with:
   - `field_3536 = studentId`, `field_3537 = activityId`
   - `field_3539 = now` (date assigned)
   - `field_3543 = 'assigned'`
   - `field_3546 = 'staff_assigned'`

This ensures the staff-added origin is visible without duplicating data into Object_6 CSVs.

### Student View (Staff Modal)
- Activities are grouped by VESPA category (Vision/Effort/Systems/Practice/Attitude) matching the student UI.
- ‚ÄúView‚Äù button opens the detail modal.
- Default tab:
  - If the activity is completed and we have responses, open ‚ÄúResponses‚Äù.
  - Otherwise open ‚ÄúQuestions‚Äù.
  - ‚ÄúBackground‚Äù (and a PDF download if present) remains available as a tab.

### Data Loading Order
1) Activities: from `view_3178` (table) ‚Üí fallback API ‚Üí CDN JSON (1c)
2) Students: role view (`view_3192‚Äì3195`) via Knack.views; if needed, enrich by API to ensure connection fields exist
3) Answers: API (Object_46), `field_1300` for JSON; `field_1302` for activity ID
4) Questions: API (Object_45) filter by `field_1286` (activity name)
5) Progress: API (Object_126), reduce to latest per activity for origin badges

### Inclusion of Self‚ÄëSelected Activities
The student modal renders the union set of activity IDs from:
- `student.prescribedActivityIds`
- `student.prescribedActivities` (names mapped to IDs)
- `student.finishedActivities` (CSV of IDs)
- Activities found in the student‚Äôs progress (Object_126)

This ensures self‚Äëselected incomplete activities are visible alongside prescribed ones.

### Styling
- CSS file: `staff/VESPAactivitiesStaff2f.css`
- Completed cards are greyed with a subtle ribbon
- Chips use palette colors (teal/blue/purple/grey)
- Category sections (`.vespa-vision/effort/systems/practice/attitude`) match student theming

### Deployment Notes
- Bump file names (2f/2g) to clear CDN cache (update Knack custom code to the new URLs)
- Ensure the immediate-hide CSS is active to prevent data view flash (`view_3177`, `view_3178`, `view_3192‚Äì3195`)
- Verify API keys in Knack (X-Knack-Application-Id / X-Knack-REST-API-Key) are present

### Quick Test Checklist
1) Load staff page ‚Üí no data view flash; themed sections visible
2) Assign one activity ‚Üí student shows Staff Added chip; Progress record exists
3) Student starts non‚Äëprescribed activity ‚Üí Self Selected chip appears
4) Prescribed activities show Prescribed chip; completed cards greyed
5) Detail modal opens on Responses (if completed & responses exist) or Questions; Background/PDF is accessible


1. Verify VESPA score field mappings with live data
2. Test with real staff admin account (2000+ students)
3. Implement search functionality for large datasets
4. Add export capability for bulk operations
5. Consider virtual scrolling for extreme cases (5000+ students)
