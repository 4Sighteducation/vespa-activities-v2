# VESPA Staff Activities - Completed Activities Fix

## Date: January 2025
## Status: Completed Activities Logic Clarified and Enhanced

---

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to understand why completed activities aren't matching:
- Logs all finished activity IDs from field_1380
- Logs prescribed activity names from field_1683
- Shows warnings when activities can't be found
- Special debug output for Alena Ramsey and Ian Woodard

### 2. Clarified Activity Counting Logic
The system now tracks TWO different counts:
- **Prescribed Completed**: Activities that are BOTH prescribed AND completed
- **Total Completed**: ALL activities the student has completed (regardless of prescription)

This explains why:
- Alena Ramsey shows 0/2 prescribed completed (none of her 17 completed match her 2 prescribed)
- Ian Woodard shows 5/12 prescribed completed (only 5 of his 8 completed match his 12 prescribed)

### 3. Added "All Completed" Tab
The student details modal now has THREE tabs:
1. **Prescribed Incomplete**: Shows prescribed activities not yet done
2. **Prescribed Completed**: Shows prescribed activities that are completed
3. **All Completed**: Shows ALL completed activities with a "✓ Prescribed" badge for prescribed ones

### 4. Updated UI Display
- Progress Overview now shows both "Prescribed Completed" and "Total Completed"
- All Completed tab shows which activities were prescribed vs self-selected
- Added green "✓ Prescribed" badge to distinguish prescribed activities

## Understanding the Data

### Why Alena Shows 0 Prescribed Completed
- She has completed 17 activities (in field_1380)
- She has 2 prescribed activities (in field_1683)
- NONE of her 17 completed activities match her 2 prescribed ones
- This is why she shows 0/2 prescribed completed

### Why Ian Shows Different Numbers
- He has 8 total completed activities (in field_1380)
- He has 12 prescribed activities (in field_1683)
- Only 5 of his completed activities match prescribed ones
- So he shows 5/12 prescribed completed

## Field Mappings Documented

Created `VESPA_STAFF_FIELD_MAPPINGS.md` with all field numbers and their purposes:
- field_1683: Prescribed activities (connected field with names)
- field_1380: Completed activities (comma-separated IDs)
- And all other relevant fields

---

## Action Items for You

### 1. Check Field Numbers
The activity preview is trying to use these fields from Object_44:
- field_1281: Background/Context Info
- field_1282: Learning Objective
- field_1283: Additional Content
- field_1284: Time in Minutes

**Please verify these field numbers exist**. If not, either:
- Provide the correct field numbers
- Or we'll remove these features from the preview

### 2. Review Console Logs
Open browser console and look for:
- "WARNING: Could not find activity for prescribed name"
- Debug output for specific students
- This will help identify any data mismatches

### 3. Verify Activity IDs
Check that:
- Activity IDs in field_1380 are valid Object_44 record IDs
- Prescribed activity names in field_1683 exist in Object_44

## Next Steps

1. Test the new "All Completed" tab to see all student activities
2. Check if the field numbers for background info are correct
3. Monitor console logs to identify any data issues
4. Let me know if you want to adjust the counting logic
