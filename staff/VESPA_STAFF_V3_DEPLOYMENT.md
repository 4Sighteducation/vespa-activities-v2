- **Activity overview cards** - Hover to see activity names by category

### Page 2: Individual Student Details

## üìÅ Files Created

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Upload files to CDN**
   ```
   VESPAactivitiesStaff3a.js

   ```

2. **Update Knack custom code**
   Replace the old file references with:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="[CDN_URL]/VESPAactivitiesStaff3a.css">
   <script src="[CDN_URL]/VESPAactivitiesStaff3a.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Clear CDN cache** if using a caching CDN

4. **Test with different roles**
   - Staff Admin
   - Tutor
   - Head of Year
   - Subject Teacher

## üîß Configuration

## üêõ Known Considerations

2. **Activity questions** - Currently loads from API. Falls back gracefully if not available.

3. **Progress records** - Creates new progress records when staff assigns activities.

These can be added once core functionality is stable:
- Bulk assignment to multiple students
- Export functionality
- Advanced filtering options
- Activity feedback system
- Student response viewing
- Performance tracking over time

## üîë Critical Field Mappings

Maintained from original system:
```javascript
// Student (Object_6)
curriculum: 'field_1683'      // Prescribed activities
completed: 'field_1380'       // Finished activities CSV
vespaConnection: 'field_182'  // VESPA scores link

// Activities (Object_44)
activityName: 'field_1278'
activityCategory: 'field_1285'
activityLevel: 'field_3568'

// Progress (Object_126)
progressStudent: 'field_3536'
progressActivity: 'field_3537'
progressStatus: 'field_3543'
progressOrigin: 'field_3546'
```

## üìû Support
