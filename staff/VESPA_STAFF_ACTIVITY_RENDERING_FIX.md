# VESPA Staff Activity Rendering Fix
## Date: January 2025

## Issue Summary
Activities were not rendering properly due to:
1. CORS errors when loading activities1e.json
2. API authentication issues (403 Forbidden) when calling Object_44
3. Unclear which view IDs contain the activity data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. CORS Issue Resolution
- Added fallback to embedded activity data when JSON loading fails
- Attempted multiple paths including CDN/GitHub sources
- Embedded key activities directly in the code for reliable fallback

### 2. API Authentication Fix
- Removed direct API calls to Object_44 (was getting 403 errors)
- Now uses cached activity data from initial load
- Falls back to generating content based on activity category/level

### 3. View ID Flexibility
- Now checks multiple possible view IDs (view_3176, view_3177, view_3178)
- Added support for different Knack table structures (.kn-list-table, .kn-table, .kn-list-content)
- Logs which view contains data for debugging

## Current State

### ✅ Working
- Activity preview shows content (either from JSON or generated)
- Questions load properly with fallback to category-specific defaults
- Progress bars and student data display correctly
- Review button in Assign modal works

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Activities JSON must be hosted with proper CORS headers for external loading
- Direct API calls to Object_44 don't work due to authentication
- Using embedded fallback data for common activities

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix JSON Loading
Host activities1e.json on a CDN that supports CORS:
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 with CORS enabled
- Dedicated CDN service

### Option 2: Use Knack Storage
Store activity content in a Knack object that can be accessed via the authenticated API

### Option 3: Embed All Activities
Expand the embedded activities array to include all activities (increases file size but ensures reliability)

## Testing
1. Click "View" on a student to see their activities
2. Click on any activity card to see the preview
3. Click "Assign" and then "Review" on any activity
4. Check console for any error messages

## Files Modified
- VESPAactivitiesStaff1w.js - Main implementation with fixes
- VESPAactivitiesStaff1v.css - Styling for activity previews

## Key Methods
- `loadActivitiesFromJSON()` - Loads activity data with fallbacks
- `getEmbeddedActivities()` - Returns embedded activity data
- `loadActivityAdditionalData()` - Gets activity content for preview
- `viewEnhancedActivityPreview()` - Shows the activity preview modal
