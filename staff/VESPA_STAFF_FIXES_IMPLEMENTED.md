# VESPA Staff Activities - Fixes Implemented

## Date: January 2025
## Status: All Critical Issues Fixed

---

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. Fixed HTML Display Issues
**Problem**: Activities were displaying raw HTML instead of clean text.

**Solution**: 
- Added `stripHtml()` method that properly removes all HTML tags and entities
- Applied HTML stripping to all text fields in both `parseStudentFromRecord()` and `parseActivityFromRecord()`
- The method handles HTML entities like `&nbsp;` and removes data attributes

**Code Location**: Lines 721-736 (stripHtml method)

---

### 2. Fixed Completed Activities Logic
**Problem**: Showing illogical counts like "17 / 1" because system was counting ALL completed activities instead of just prescribed ones.

**Solution**:
- Modified `parseStudentFromRecord()` to:
  - Track prescribed activity IDs separately
  - Count only prescribed activities that are completed
  - Calculate progress based on prescribed activities, not a baseline
- Added logic to match activity names to IDs for accurate comparison

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Now tracks:
prescribedActivityIds: [], // IDs of prescribed activities
completedCount: actualCompletedCount, // Only counts prescribed activities that are completed
progress: progressPercentage // Based on prescribed activities
```

---

### 3. Fixed Data Type Mismatch
**Problem**: prescribedActivities contained names while finishedActivities contained IDs.

**Solution**:
- Added conversion logic to match prescribed activity names to their IDs
- Comparison now works correctly by comparing IDs to IDs
- Added case-insensitive matching with HTML stripping

---

### 4. Improved Activity Matching
**Problem**: Activities weren't being found due to HTML in names.

**Solution**:
- Updated `showStudentDetailsModal()` to use stripHtml when matching activities
- Added warning logs when activities can't be found
- Made matching case-insensitive

---

### 5. Added Debugging Support
- Added logging for activity level parsing to help diagnose if levels aren't displaying
- Logs show raw field values and parsed results when debug mode is enabled

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify HTML Stripping**:
   - Check that activity names display cleanly without HTML tags
   - Ensure no data attributes or onclick handlers are visible

2. **Verify Counts**:
   - Completed count should never exceed prescribed count
   - Format should be "X / Y" where X â‰¤ Y

3. **Verify Completed Tab**:
   - Activities marked as completed should appear in the completed tab
   - Only prescribed activities should show as completed

4. **Check Activity Levels**:
   - Monitor console logs to see if level data is being returned from Knack
   - If levels still show as "1", the issue may be with Knack field configuration

---

## Potential Remaining Issues

1. **Activity Levels**: If levels still display as "Level 1", check:
   - Whether field_1295 is populated in Knack
   - Whether the field is included in the API response
   - Console logs will show the actual values being returned

2. **Performance**: With the new matching logic, loading may be slightly slower for users with many prescribed activities. Monitor performance and consider caching if needed.

## Next Steps

1. Test thoroughly with real data
2. Monitor console logs for any warnings or errors
3. If activity levels still don't display correctly, investigate Knack field configuration
4. Consider adding error recovery for edge cases
