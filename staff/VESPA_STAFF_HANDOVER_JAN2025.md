## CRITICAL ISSUE: Activities Not Rendering

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: While many fixes have been implemented, activities are still not rendering properly in the UI. The activity preview shows "No background information available" even though the fields are correctly mapped.

---

## Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Fixed HTML Display Issues ✅
- Added `stripHtml()` method to clean all HTML artifacts
- Applied to all text fields in student and activity parsing
- No more raw HTML showing in activity names

### 2. Fixed Completed Activities Logic ✅
- System now correctly counts only prescribed activities that are completed
- Fixed the "17/1" issue - now shows accurate counts like "0/2" or "5/12"
- Added `totalCompletedCount` to track ALL completed activities separately

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard for Self-Selected Activities ✅
- Added dual progress bars:
  - Blue: Prescribed activities progress
  - Green: Total activities progress (including self-selected)
- Updated completed column to show "prescribed / total"
- Added progress legend explaining the new system
- Added info note about self-selection capability

### 4. Enhanced Student Details Modal ✅
- Three tabs now:
  1. Prescribed Incomplete
  2. Prescribed Completed  
  3. All Completed (shows all with "✓ Prescribed" badges)
- Shows both prescribed and total progress clearly

### 5. Updated Activity Preview ✅
- Changed to use correct fields:
  - `field_1293`: Background Information
  - `field_1289`: Additional Resources (with PDF extraction)
- Added dynamic time calculation (15-45 minutes)
- Added PDF download button
- Added CSS to control image sizes from rich text

## Current Issues

### 1. Activities Not Rendering
Despite correct field mappings, activities show "No background information available". This suggests:
- Fields might be empty in Knack
- OR field numbers might be incorrect
- OR there's an issue with how we're loading the data

### 2. Debugging Needed
Check console for:
- Activity data being loaded
- Field values from API responses
- Any errors in `loadActivityAdditionalData()`

---

## Field Mappings (Object_44)

Currently using:
- `field_1293`: Background Information (rich text)
- `field_1289`: Additional Resources (rich text with PDF)
- `field_1278`: Activity Name
- `field_1285`: VESPA Category
- `field_1295`: Activity Level

These need verification in Knack.

---

## Key Methods to Review

### 1. `loadActivityAdditionalData()` (line ~2404)
This loads the background info and resources. Check if:
- API call is successful
- Response contains expected fields
- Fields have actual content

### 2. `stripHtml()` (line ~721)
Has optional parameter to preserve formatting for rich text display

### 3. `parseStudentFromRecord()` (line ~744)
Now properly:
- Counts prescribed vs total completed
- Matches activity names to IDs
- Calculates accurate progress

---

## Console Debugging

Enable debug mode and look for:
```javascript
// For specific students
"=== DEBUG: Alena Ramsey ==="
"Prescribed activities:", [...]
"Finished activity IDs:", [...]

// For activities
"Activity data:", response
"Field 1293:", response.field_1293
"Field 1289:", response.field_1289
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Field Numbers**
   - Check in Knack that field_1293 and field_1289 exist
   - Confirm they contain data for test activities
   - Update field numbers if incorrect

2. **Debug Activity Loading**
   - Add console.log to `loadActivityAdditionalData()`
   - Check what's in the API response
   - Verify data is being passed to the modal

3. **Test with Known Activity**
   - Pick an activity you know has background info
   - Check if it loads correctly
   - Compare API response to what's displayed

4. **Consider Fallback**
   - If fields don't exist, remove those features
   - OR use different fields that do contain data

## Contact for Questions

The main issues are:
1. Activities not rendering background info
2. Need to verify field numbers in Knack

The dual progress system is working well and clearly shows the distinction between prescribed and self-selected activities.
