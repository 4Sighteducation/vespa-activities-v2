        "text": "LEARN 💡 In his 1998 book, How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable About Anything, American psychologist Albert Ellis looked at irrational and negative thinking experienced by people in times of stress. He particularly looked at types of thoughts that people experience when things go badly. He called this ‘crooked thinking’. His work can be directly applied to students in stressful situations – see if you’ve experienced these kinds of thoughts when things go wrong: Not fair thinking: - ‘I don’t deserve this treatment. Things shouldn’t be like this.’ Catastrophe thinking - : ‘If this goes wrong, it’ll be a total nightmare.’ Stopper thinking - : ‘I’m useless. I can’t do this. I’m bound to screw up.’ Illogical thinking: - ‘If this bad thing happens, this one will surely follow.’ Blaming Thinking - ‘It’s his fault. It’s everyone’s fault except me.’ Overgeneralising: - ‘I never get the breaks. This always happens to me. Everything is going wrong in my life.’ Alison Ledgerwood, University of California professor of P sychology , studies how people tend to get stuck in particular ways of thinking and what they can do to get unstuck. In her video below she explains how the brain is wired for negative thoughts, and suggests how to change it.",

Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist at Harvard University, has looked at why people adopt this pose and the effects it can have on your physiology. She has found that by changing your physiology (or your posture) you can have a profound effect on how you feel. In her 2012 TED talk, ‘Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are’, she argues that by standing in certain ‘power poses’ you can increase your confidence and self-esteem, enhance your memory and reduce feelings of fear. Cuddy goes on to argue that weaker postures (such as curling up, making yourself small or moving into defensive positions) trigger other psychological responses – feelings of imminent danger, stress or threat. And yet we often see nervous students hunched over their notes or hiding in a corner in those last few moments before an exam! Instead, we think it’s worth trying more confident and powerful postures before taking your final exams or important assessments.",

He says that those who have become brilliant at something have got better at it quickly because they have made a lot of mistakes and they have paid attention to their mistakes and drawn the learning out from them. So, failure is important if we are ultimately going to succeed. There are, however, different attitudes to failure. Some students hate it and avoid it at all costs. It makes them feel embarrassed, humiliated, worthless. They hide mistakes, don’t complete tests or skip hard homework so they can avoid failing. As a result they make slower progress. Other students recognise the importance of failure. Your job is to try to become one of these people.

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Our response to getting feedback can vary considerably. Some people are hungry for feedback and want to know how they can improve; others avoid feedback like the plague and take it personally. If you want to get good grades at GCSE you are going to have to get comfortable with feedback. Steve Bull, in his brilliant book The Game Plan (2006), has developed an acronym, SADRAA , to help you with the process. He suggests that when you get feedback you might not be happy with, you should work through three stages: the red zone, the blue zone and the green zone. The image below explains the zones. Low performing pupils can sometimes get caught up in the red zone and some might never leave. You might know people like this! It’s fine to have these initial emotions, of course, but then you must push through the next two stages. The next time that you have some feedback that you might not be happy with, use this activity to record your own thoughts or check in with your emotional response to the criticism and see which zone you’re in. Then look ahead to the next zone and see what kind of thoughts you might try to have to move yourself through the process more quickly. Ultimately, you’ll be much happier if you avoid getting stuck in the red or blue zone! It might be tricky to get to the green zone, so feel free to leave it a day or so – maybe longer – before completing the final section or considering the ideas you see there. Below is an example of some feedback given to a sociology student: The feedback is quite detailed and could easily be viewed as critical, particularly if the student had put in a lot of effort into their work. The table below shows how the SADRAA process might work with this feedback, and how important it is to get through to the final stages.",

        "text": "REFLECT🤔 Final Thoughts One way to fully understand Bull’s model is to watch other people responding to feedback. Watch for feedback after a sporting fxture, and see how players react. Watch out for how your parents describe taking feedback, or even your teachers. Most of all, watch for how your friends talk about feedback. If you’re surrounded by people who can’t take feedback, it makes it harder to learn how to handle it well. Austin Kleon (2014), a writer and artist, warns us to; \"..make sure we have positive friends.\" He calls negative friends ‘vampires’. Kleon advises that, “if, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire.” It’s worth thinking about the five people you spend most time with, and asking yourself fve questions about them: Are they positive people? Do they enjoy their lives? Are they a good infuence? Have they helped you through problems? Do they make you feel good about yourself, and about life?",

Three hundred pupils were asked to refect on challenging periods of their lives: poor results, breaking up with partners, feeling insulted or ofended, or being rejected from a particular course. Of the 300 subjects, 100 were asked to specifically focus on the lessons they had learned – the positive benefts that had eventually come from these challenges. It turned out that it was these pupils who coped better with their disasters and moved on from them. Emmons and McCullough found that positive benefts could flow from negative experiences. David Collins, professor of coaching and performance at the University of Central Lancashire , has coached at the very top level, including being responsible for UK athletics at the Beijing Olympic Games. Collins, with his colleague Áine MacNamara, has done similar work to Emmons and McCullough. He’s discovered that top athletes have travelled what he calls a ‘rocky road’. This means that they’ve usually had their fair share of setbacks, failures and disappointments along the way. Often, we don’t get to hear about these setbacks – we only hear about the successes! Professor Collins suggests that the rocky road might even be good for you as you will develop some useful skills along the way. The key thing is not to dwell on the setback and to bounce back. The iceburg illusion is another common way to demonstrate the level of effort required \" below the surface\" for success, which are not apparent on the \"surface\" .

If you want a word in your head to help clear thoughts, the word can be ‘right’ as you imagine a pen travelling rightwards as it draws the bottom line of the box. Once you’re full, hold the breath for four seconds. Breath 2: Breathe out through the slightly open mouth. Take four seconds to totally empty your lungs. The word ‘up’ can be mentally repeated here if you need, as you imagine a line being drawn up to make the right-hand side of the box. When you’re totally empty, hold for four seconds. Breath 3: Breathe in through the nose until the lungs are full and the chest is expanded. Take four seconds to fll your lungs. If you want a word in your head to help clear thoughts, the word can be ‘left’ as you imagine a pen travelling leftwards across the top line of the box. Once you’re full, hold the breath for four seconds. Breath 4: Breathe out through the slightly open mouth. Take four seconds to totally empty your lungs. The word ‘down’ can be mentally repeated here if you need, as you imagine a line being drawn down to complete the box. When you’re totally empty, hold for four seconds. You’re done! 2 - DELIBERATE KINDNESS Suggested by a leader at Google, this deliberate kindness exercise takes very little time, but when repeated it has hugely positive efects. Because stress or anxiety is a focus on the self, activities like this work because they require you to place your focus on others. Version 1: Choose three people – parents, friends, peers, tutors or teachers, brothers, sisters or cousins. Give each of them ten seconds of your time, bringing them to mind, one at a time, as vividly as you can. Mentally say: ‘I wish for this person to be happy.’ Imagine them happy. Repeat the phrase mentally if you need to for ten seconds. Repeat for your three people. That’s it. Version 2: (Try this in a public place – a study room, library, cafe, bus station, watching a crowd through a window somewhere.) Cast your eyes over the crowds around you and choose three random people. Give each of them ten seconds of your time, one at a time, as vividly as you can. Mentally say: ‘I wish for this person to be happy.’ Imagine them happy. Repeat the phrase mentally if you need to for ten seconds. Do it for three people. You’re done. When repeated, this exercise trains your brain to spend just a little time focusing on others. Writer, teacher and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss says the following in his book Tools of Titans (2017, p. 159): ‘I tend to do a single 3- to 5-minute session at night, thinking of three people I want to be happy, often two current friends and one old friend I haven’t seen in years. A mere three days into doing this … I found myself wondering throughout the day “Why am I so happy?” … you easily get caught in the whirlpool of thinking about your “stuff\" This loving-kindness drill takes the focus of you entirely – which, for me, immediately resolves at least 90% of the mental chatter.’ 3 - CONCERN vs CONTROL This activity, adapted from Stephen Covey’s excellent book 'The 7 Habits of Highly Efective People (1989)' , asks you spend five minutes or so listing the things that are taking up your mental space and energy. Here’s what you do: Listen to your anxieties and worries (your ‘mental chatter’ as Tim Ferriss calls it) and write it all down – for example, ‘worrying about the news’, ‘worrying about what questions might appear on my next exam’, ‘stressing about what people might think of my recent post on social media’, ‘thinking about ice cream’. Put them in all in one big circle, so they look like they’re all jostling around in your head. Now draw a second circle, of to the right or left, away from your head. Next, review every item in the circle that looks like your head, crowded with crazy thoughts and issues, one at a time. For each item, ask yourself, ‘What control do I have over this?’ If there’s something you can do to control the outcome of the worry, it stays in the frst circle (your head). Label this circle ‘control’. If there’s little or nothing you can do to control the outcome of the thought or worry, it leaves your head and goes to the second circle. This is going to be called ‘concern’ – the things you think about but have little or no infuence over. People who handle stress well minimise the stuff in the ‘concern’ circle. They practise forgetting about it. They spend their energy on the things in the ‘control’ circle and make plans. Finish the exercise by deciding one simple thing you could do to improve each of the issues/situations in your circle of control.",

        "text": "REFLECT🤔 Final Thoughts Feeling anxious or stressed about study is often a matter of perspective – about shifting your focus away from the self towards something else. That’s why anything that makes you feel small or insignifcant helps clear your head. If you’re interested, here’s two ways to do it: The outdoors: We’ve spoken to pupils who have walked to the top of a hill near their house. From the top, the hugeness of the world makes them feel tiny. And that helps make them feel better. (“My problems seem stupid and small,” one pupil told us.) Another, looking out across the whole city, realised that there were others with much bigger troubles than they had. The night sky Another way to help realise the smallness of your life on this planet is to gaze at the star-flled sky. Again, all of a sudden, an issue with a GCSE test seems tiny in comparison to the vastness of the universe. And that can help you re-gain perspective.",

As a result, he has developed a series of interesting tools for boosting people’s confdence in their own ability. In his book, The Game Plan (2006) , Bull says, ‘It seems to be a human frailty that we are programmed to focus on failure and disappointment far more than on success and accomplishment. We find it very easy to recall those disastrous days when everything went wrong.’ He goes on to say that ‘When we are faced with a similar challenge, our brains are quick to recall the previous catastrophe.’ He then concludes that ‘the cycle must be broken, and the most efective way of doing this is to actively reconnect your mind with previous accomplishments’. Dr Bull worked with cricketers asking them to record their previous successes, and saw their confdence rocket and their performances improve as a result. Bull uses mountain peaks as his confidence metaphor, but we prefer the image of a phone battery. We like the idea of a battery because confidence in your ability gives you energy. It charges you up and flls you with strength and belief. You can keep your battery topped up by recalling those times when things went brilliantly and you really achieved what you were capable of. This activity asks you to imagine you have five energy slots to fill in your battery, above. You should fill each slot with a brief description of a time when you performed really well and achieved something you are pleased with or proud of. When you’re feeling low, you can return to your battery, read the information there and feel yourself recharge with positivity and purpose.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Sometimes it’s easy to forget how many people want to help you succeed. Each of us has a signifcant network of support around us, but it’s a natural tendency sometimes to think, ‘If I ask for help it must mean I’m failing. I need to do this alone.’ But seeking help just makes everything easier. So don’t believe the story that goes, ‘One day I’ll have to stand on my own two feet. I may as well start now.’ As you grow up and face new challenges, there will always be people around you who can help; someone who’s done it before and can give you some advice. Nowadays, that help is just a search engine away – you can contact experts in thousands of felds through social media. You could spend a very successful life continually asking for help! But still the myth persists that we must do it alone. This activity should support you in auditing (that means listing and organising) every single person who could be on your team. And from there, you can decide who you need to help you with some upcoming challenges. The image above depicts your network of influence. You’re the dot at the top and underneath you is a team of people all waiting for the chance to support you. First, make a list of everyone you can think of that fits into the categories above. Think of friends you have at school, but also those you might have outside of school, on social media or at other schools. Who among your peers has the potential to help you out? Who, a few years older, has gone through this already? Who’s an expert on the subjects you’re struggling with? Which of your friends has an older brother or sister you could speak to? Think about your parents, of course, but also aunties, uncles, cousins and family friends. You attend a school where every paid member of staff has a genuine interest in helping you improve. Your first thoughts might be your own teachers, but what about other staff members – librarians, tutors and mentors? All of them will have something to offer.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 This activity is based on the work of David Kolb of the University of Leicester. Kolb’s work suggests that we learn best through experience – through doing. If we take action and attempt a challenge (therefore experiencing something rather than just reading or thinking about it) our awareness, understanding and mastery increases. Kolb proposes that ‘experiential learning’, as he calls it, passes through four phases. When we frst saw Kolb’s work, his four phases were presented as a framework for problem solving. It worked really well for us and we became hooked. We’ll share what we learned with you here. You’ll need to set aside thirty minutes to start with. First, choose a problem you’re battling with or a barrier you’re facing. It might be to do with study habits, current performance, levels of energy or a subject-specifc issue. Next break down the problem into the four stages of Kolb’s problem solving cycle. Use the guidance below to inform you how to approach each stage First an example problem: \"I use to be really good at maths but have got worse since starting my GCSE's. My last assessment was a grade 4, a drop of 2 grades! I seem to be getting worse just when I need to be getting better!! The final exam is in 3 months and I feel really worried about it\" The following images show how we can use Kolbs learning cycle to try and solve this common problem. Stage 1 - Explore the problem using \"concrete experience\" Stage 2 - Analyse the problem - consider why it is happening? Stage 3 - Decide on a course of action, consider all your options (this is called abstract conceptualisation) Stage 4 - Finally experiment with an action, review after a week to consider how successful the action was. Each of us apparently has a preference for one of these stages and might have a tendency to linger in it or even stay there as long as possible. We all know someone who endlessly talks about a problem without ever doing something about it. That person might feel most comfortable in stage 2 – analysing the problem.

Her research has focused on helping pupils to improve their memory, which is pretty useful for GCSE pupils. She shared this activity with us – many thanks, Jennifer. Over to you! Taking a test does more than just assess your abilities; research has shown that it can also improve your memory for the information tested. Henry Roediger at Washington University has led the research in this area, now known as the ‘testing effect’. The term ‘test’ in this context refers to the act of retrieving information from your long-term memory. This can take many forms such as reciting facts about the Second World War aloud or completing a practice essay question. The test format is irrelevant; as long as you recall the information from memory, the rate at which you forget this information in the future is slowed down. This is in stark contrast to repeated study (reading over notes/highlighting text); when this technique is used information is forgotten much more quickly afterwards. Despite huge amounts of research all showing the clear benefits of testing, most pupils prefer to revise for exams by reading information repeatedly. This is because the more you read something, the more familiar the content feels, resulting in a false sense of understanding and accomplishment. In contrast, testing yourself can feel challenging and frustrating, especially when you start to revise a new topic and it feels like you are not recalling very much at all. Don’t let this put you off: searching for the right answer (even unsuccessfully) strengthens the pathways in your brain for that information. Although it may feel counterintuitive to test yourself, struggling is good for your brain and results in excellent learning in the end! Remember that all exams require you to recall information; it is unlikely that an exam will test you on how well you can read text over and over again . Every time you test yourself you are reinforcing the connections in your brain in an outward direction, making them increasingly accessible for when you need it most – in an exam! Top tips for testing yourself: Create elaborate links between new information and existing knowledge - This will make it easier to cue yourself during tests. Mind-maps are a great way of testing yourself - Close your books and scribble down everything you can remember. Number the points to track your progress. Feedback is essential when testing yourself - This prevents you learning any mistakes you may have made. This is especially important if you are using multiple choice tests as the right and wrong answers can be very similar. Follow our activity to build yourself a killer test.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Cal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. He’s written a few great books to help pupils achieve the best grades they can. It’s worth taking a look at his website: www.calnewport.com . In addition to teaching pupils at university, he’s been fascinated by the strategies pupils use to help them get great grades. He suggests that when it comes to revision there are two types: active recall and passive recall. Active recall - actively trying to understand and synthesise the information by teaching it . (Don’t worry – you don’t need your own class of year 7s for this! You can do it alone, or to someone else; a friend, a parent or a sibling.) Passive recall - by contrast, is just sitting passively reading your notes. Newport makes a bold statement: active recall is the only revision strategy that counts! He argues that there are three huge benefits to this type of super-charged revision: It’s very effective. It saves time. It’s difficult and mentally uncomfortable. (Don’t worry, it’s supposed to be!) So how to do you do it? We’ve set a little challenge for you. We want you to only use active recall for the next test you have in one of your subjects. During this time you are not allowed to use any other strategy. You are either doing active recall or preparing for it. No sitting comfortably and reading your notes! If you’re interested in trying this experiment, you’ll need to start about three weeks before a test or mock exam and you’ll need to set aside a few hours each week. Block the time out on your planner before you start, then follow our CASTT process. Week 1: Collect and Arrange (C and A) This week is preparation week – we call it ‘collect and arrange’ because it gives you chance to gather everything you need and make sense of it. The first thing you need to do is identify and collect the topics that you will be tested on; make a list of them. A syllabus might help here, or a list provided by a teacher. Once you’ve got your list of topics, you’re really in business. You know the size of the job ahead of you. Once you’ve identified and collected together your topics you need to arrange or organise your notes for the topics, and try and condense the material into a small space – one or two sides of A4, for example. It might be useful to use mind-maps for this, or other graphic organisers like tables, lists, bullet-points or flow charts. Weeks 2 and 3: Search (S) and Teach (T) Now you’ll need to do a search for any past paper questions connected to the topics you’ve collected and arranged in week 1. You’re trying to find example tests that are as close to the one you’re going to experience in the test coming up – in other words, to reproduce the test experience! Search everywhere. Do you already have exam questions in your books or folders? Did your teachers hand some out? Are there some on your school’s online resources or in the school library? Maybe an exam-board website can help. You want to be the person who has searched out more exam questions than anyone else! Once you’ve got your hoard, you can begin teaching – in other words, it’s active recall only! Grab your exam question, write it in the middle of a piece of A4 and plan an answer around it. Now: imagine you’re a teacher, explaining how to answer the question to your class. Imagine this class really need things explaining slowly and clearly, and you’re at the front with a whiteboard, explaining exactly what to do, how to do it and why to do it. In week 2 it might be that you try to teach the information with only yourself present. Have the mind-map in front of you and aim to recall and explain as much information as possible without looking. It might be useful to cover up your mind-map and then just expose sections if you are struggling. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect – it won’t be at first. Remember that you have to speak out loud. It will feel odd at first but just keep going. In week 3 you might try teaching with an audience. Give someone the mind-map while you try to recall. Get the observer to make a note of anything you miss. Then try it again. Finally: Test (T) Finally, to check that the process is working effectively you must test yourself. Put away all the midmaps and notes from week one, two and three, clear your desk and put your phone on airplane settings. Now, write a response to the exam question under timed conditions. Take it to a teacher for marking, or check it against a mark scheme. And that’s it! Active recall in four steps. It might not always feel easy or relaxed, but it’s quick, intense, and effective. Remember CASTT next time you need to practice for a test or exam!",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 For some pupils the only work they ever do has been set by their teacher: Do you ever do more? We’ve found that the top performing pupils are usually setting their own work if their teacher hasn’t set it for them. This can be hard, though, particularly if you aren’t sure exactly what work to set yourself. Teachers quite often say to pupils that they should be doing ‘independent learning’ or ‘reading around the subject’ . But what does that actually mean? We would suggest that you get much more specific and design your independent learning so that you know exactly what you should be doing and how long it should take you. Your teacher will also have some ideas about specific independent learning you could be doing so don't forget to ask. Five Independent Learning Activities For each of your GCSE subjects we suggest that you design five activities. Use the following stages to create each activity First, identify the topic - What is it you’d like to spend some more time on? Second, decide what are you going to do - e.g. Watch a YouTube video, read a book or do some online research? Third, find where you need to go to get access to the resources - e.g. the specific link to the Youtube clip, or chapter of a textbook F inally, decide which activity are you going to do? - Remember, doing some active work is going to be more beneficial than passive activities, e.g. Making a mind-map, or create some flashcards. We have created a list below, with our top 15 independent learning activities to choose from: Creating flashcards as a memory aid. Making a clear, visual overview of a course, connecting all the content in a huge diagram/mind-map. Reading lots of exam questions and seeing if you can recognise ‘types’ or ‘genres’ of question. Asking for extra work to be assessed and carefully reading the feedback you get. Creating a glossary of key words with definitions. Expanding class notes with reference to textbooks. Representing complicated information visually using a table, chart or diagram. Reading through an examiners’ report and making a list of dos and don’ts. Choosing a specific area of difficulty and discussing it in detail with a friend. Planning responses to past exam questions. Borrowing someone else’s class notes and using them to expand yours. Finding a brilliant course textbook and reading a chapter, making notes as you go. Watching online videos and interacting with associated VLE resources. Arranging a meeting with an older student or sibling who has done the course before. Writing for twenty minutes under timed conditions. Try the following activity to start developing your independent learning",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 The places we choose to work in often have a big impact on how effective our work is. Our environments can influence the quality of our concentration and focus in both positive and negative ways. An interesting study by two researchers at Reading University, Derek Clements-Croome and Li Baizhan (2000) , found that UK office workers felt significantly less productive as their work environment became more crowded or cramped, as temperatures varied or the quality of light diminished. A large majority of the subjects interviewed estimated they might get a 10% rise in productivity if their environment was better. We’ve seen similar effects with thousands of pupils over twenty years of teaching. And, surprisingly, we’ve seen pupils who deliberately sit down to work in noisy, distracting locations so they can be disturbed. When we meet to talk about their lack of progress, they’ll often tell us, ‘Well, I tried to work, but I couldn’t concentrate,’ or ‘I like working with lots of people around me.’ Inevitably, when we check the quality of their work, they’ve expended lots of time but in fact got very little done. What are your work environments like, and what link might they have to your levels of focus, concentration and flow? By figuring out where you work best, you can increase your levels of concentration – and get more quality work done in less time. Changing Spaces Benedict Carey, in his book How We Learn, discusses some fascinating research about environment and memory. Research shows that changing the space in which you study increases your chances of remembering the material you’ve studied. Something about the freshness and variation in space makes the material more easily accessible in your memory. Swap high flow study spaces often and you may well remember more of what you’ve studied. So, the more high flow study spaces you have at your disposal, the better you’ll do!",

And, surprisingly, we’ve\nseen pupils who deliberately sit down to work in noisy, distracting locations so they can be disturbed.\nWhen we meet to talk about their lack of progress, they’ll often tell us, ‘Well, I tried to work, but I couldn’t\nconcentrate,’ or ‘I like working with lots of people around me.’ Inevitably, when we check the quality of their\nwork, they’ve expended lots of time but in fact got very little done.\n</p><p>What are your work environments like, and what link might they have to your levels of focus, concentration\nand flow?\n</p><p>By figuring out where you work best, you can increase your levels of concentration – and get more\nquality work done in less time.\n</p><p><strong><em>Changing Spaces</em></strong>\n</p><p>Benedict Carey, in his book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-We-Learn-unlock-potential/dp/1447286340\" target=\"_blank\">How We Learn,</a></em> discusses some fascinating research about environment\nand memory. Research shows that changing the space in which you study increases your chances of\nremembering the material you’ve studied. Something about the freshness and variation in space makes\nthe material more easily accessible in your memory. Swap high flow study spaces often and you may well\nremember more of what you’ve studied.\nSo, the more high flow study spaces you have at your disposal, the better you’ll do!\n</p>",

That means rewriting or reorganising your class notes into something you have built yourself – something you’ve processed and created. No passive reading and highlighting of notes here – just active, engaged rewriting! You don’t want to be spending too much of your time on this – we recommend about 50% of your revision time should be recasting notes – but it’s a crucial step. One way to do it that we’ve really enjoyed is the nine-box grid. (An A level physics pupil taught us this one. He ended up at Oxford so we know it works!) And here’s the best bit: all you’ll need is a sheet of A4 paper. There are three steps to filling in the grid: Your challenge is to summarise an entire topic (or, if you’re feeling brave, an entire course) in nine boxes. First, you need to read through your notes on the topic/course and decide what your nine boxes are. Ask yourself: what are the nine key subsections? Ask teachers to suggest nine. Work with friends to identify the nine. Go through exam papers to see if they help you decide on the nine. Once you’ve got the nine subsections, you need to find a way to summarise your notes using just the little boxes on the grid. You can’t use any additional space. Also, don’t try to write so small you can’t read it! Use diagrams, pictures, mind-maps or other graphic organisers to condense your information. It is useful to do this using a PC so you can reduce the size of text and add images. Do what you have to, but get it all down in the nine little boxes. Then photograph or save it in case it gets lost! Below is an example from a GCSE Chemistry Syllabus (AQA) - Topic 1 - Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table: In this example our student looked at the syllabus and found there were 13 topics. Part of the process involved combining some topics together, which can also help your understanding. Now read through the whole grid and, on the other side, draw up a list of key concepts, ideas and vocabulary you’re going to need to master. That’s it. An entire course or topic on one sheet of paper. Once you’ve got your nine-box grid, you’re ready to attempt exam questions. You’ll see other pupils laboriously rereading their notes or copying out the entire course in their lucky pen – but ignore them. You’ve got the content nailed on one sheet!

It’s quite normal when you think about it. We all like to spend time on activities we feel comfortable or confident doing. The problem can be that we’re putting off things we feel uncomfortable with or don’t like doing. Everyone has heard of Usain Bolt – the world’s fastest man to ever run 100 metres. He has an interesting way of approaching his training. He works out where his weak spots are and then spends most of his time training on them. For Bolt, that’s the start of his 100 metres. He’s a big guy and getting out of the blocks requires a lot of effort for him. He says he knows that it’s his area of vulnerability. He’s not great at it (he’s ‘low skill’ when it comes to bursting from the blocks), and what’s more, he doesn’t particularly enjoy this aspect of his training (he is ‘low will’ in this area – that is, he has to force himself to do it, almost against his will). Despite these obstacles, Bolt spends a significant part of his training on this element because he knows that this is where he can improve the most. The will vs. skill matrix is a useful way of helping you to identify where you need to spend your time practising. It’s not just Bolt’s idea; it was made popular in the Tao of Coaching by Max Landsberg. Let’s see if it helps you like it helped Usain Bolt.",

In other words, rather than cram immediately before an exam, you can save time and energy by starting earlier and spacing out smaller sessions of practice and revision. You use your memory more this way. And as Benedict Carey says in his book How We Learn (2015, p. 40), ‘using memory changes memory’ . The more often something is recalled, the stronger the memory gets; a cycle of : ‘ learn, forget, relearn, remember again’ is strengthening your memory. A whole bunch of studies show that this process of spaced practice works way better than cramming. It also involves working for shorter periods rather than sitting down for epic sessions the night before an exam. That’s a win-win. But how do you space out practice? Well, that depends on how long it is before your exam In this activity we aim to build a programme of spaced practice that assumes three months until your exam, however if you’re using this at another time of year, which is closer or further away to your exams, don’t worry! A study by academic researchers at the University of California San Diego (Capeda et al., 2008) concluded the following about spacing: So, for our purposes, you need to be reviewing topics every two weeks, allowing them to fade in the gaps, then refreshing them when the next test comes along. You don’t necessarily have to do this for all your exams. Start by choosing a subject that you think needs a boost and plan out some spaced practice using a grid like the one shown below. For each subject select 3 different types of practice, spread over the 12 week period: Revise - An intial study of the topic, summarising and going over the information Deep Review - An in depth revision session, re-remembering everything Quick Review - A shorter, light touch review, just to check your memory The images below take you through the process with an example of how your schedule might look for 5 different subjects or topic areas.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 We’ve found there is a strong link between the kind of practice someone does and the outcomes they get. So, which student will do better in an exam? Student 1 does 15 hours’ revision – All of it reading and making notes. Student 2 only does 10 hours’ revision – Two hours making mind-maps, two hours creating flash cards of key terms, three hours writing timed essays, two hours working through past papers and looking for patterns in the questions asked, and half an hour doing the hardest question they could find, followed by half an hour talking it through with their teacher. Then they spend five hours out with their friends and watching TV The second student will perform better, despite revising for fewer hours! Now try our Revision Questionnaire in the link below, remembering to make a note of your scores. VESPA PRACTICE QUESTIONNAIRE When you have taken the questionnaire will notice that the revision activities have been placed into 3 categories: Content Techniques Skill Techniques Feedback Techniques Notice in our example that student 1 only does content revision, while student 2 does all three stages and then takes some time off. In our experience, student 2 will pretty much always get a better grade than student 1. And they put in fewer hours. Make sure you do some revision for each of C, S and F !

Sooner or later you’re going to get a piece of homework or coursework that you know is going to take a few hours to complete. At first this can be quite daunting.

Graham Allcott, founder of Think Productive ( http://thinkproductive.co.uk ), and author of \"how to be productivity ninja\" , uses the following defnitions for the three states: Proactive attention (fully focused, fred up, feeling fresh). Active attention (plugged in, ticking along nicely). Inactive attention (fagging, fried, foggy). He argues that really successful people get work done in all three states.

We’ve spoken to students who do the following to boost their attention: Exercise just before studying: A run, a walk, a quick jog around the block, even an intense burst of star jumps! Music just before studying: A loud burst of motivating music with headphones on. Other pre-work rituals: Some students talk about tidying their work spaces to get ‘in the zone’, or having a hot shower, or getting changed or a quick ten-minute burst of game-playing (bright, colourful puzzlers work way better than long, complex strategy or RPGs).",

The trouble with listing jobs is that a list doesn’t allow you to see the bigger picture; you can’t assess the progress of whole projects, you can only pick of small individual tasks.\n</p><p>Using a matrix or a grid helps you to assess the status of entire subjects.

Inevitably, there are going to be moments when you have too much to do and not enough time to do it in. Here’s where an action priority matrix can be super-useful. It’s a real lifesaver because it allows you to diferentiate between tasks according to how much impact they are going to have on your learning relative to the amount of energy they’ll need to get them fnished. The grid looks like this: If you’ve got too much to do, try plotting all your possible actions on this grid. List everything you could be doing to prepare for the next two or three exams. Now weight them: First, consider how much energy they’ll require. Energy means high concentration, focused time. If it’s lots, put the action towards the right. If you could do it quickly and easily, put the action towards the left. Second, consider the potential impact on your learning. If it’s high – if you feel the action could really transform your knowledge or skills – put it up towards the top. If you think it will improve your learning a little, put it towards the bottom. Once you’ve got all your possible options on the grid, have a look at which of the four quadrants the actions have fallen into and check out the advice below: Quick Wins These are gold. Get them done as a matter of urgency! They won’t take long, and they could well transform your performance in a particular subject. If you’ve got an afternoon ahead of you (maybe even a full day, lucky you!), get these tasks done while you’re feeling fresh and lively. Set a time limit for them – say to yourself, ‘I’ll do this task in thirty minutes’ or ‘I’ll give myself an hour to get this finished.’ Don’t consider any other activities on the grid until you’ve bust through all of these. Baby Steps These tasks won’t take much effort but neither will they have a massive impact. However, they could be good tasks to do if you’re feeling foggy or lacking energy. They might not require total concentration, so if you need something to do just to get you into the rhythm of working, choose one or two. Similarly, if you’ve got a spare half an hour before lunch, or a spare twenty minutes before your bus, you could fire off one of these. Try doing one on the way into school for an exam – on a bus or train or in an environment that’s not great for total concentration. Major Projects These are going to really boost your understanding and skill in a particular subject, but they’re going to take a long period of high concentration to complete. Choose them if you can fulfill the following criteria: You have two to three hours where you won’t be interrupted. You’re committed to switching of all mobile devices for two to three hours, and you won’t allow yourself to be distracted no matter what. You have access to a reasonably calm and quiet working environment. If you can’t fulfil these criteria, either change things so you can (i.e. call and cancel a meet-up, pull out of another commitment or switch location) or break the activities up. We’ve seen pupils have real success by taking a sledgehammer to a big project and bashing it into five or six smaller pieces. So instead of ‘reread the complete chemistry textbook’ (definitely a ‘major project’!), pupils have broken the task down into ‘reread chapter 1 and make notes ’ or ‘reread sections 4 and 5, picking out key ideas’. Suddenly, the big project becomes a set of smaller tasks that might end up in ‘quick win’ or ‘baby steps Hard Slogs If you’re really pushed for time, the chances are you’ll end up not doing these; all your energies should be spent on getting your quick wins done, building up a load of activities in baby steps or breaking your big projects down into more manageable tasks. Watch out, though – sometimes we might put an activity into ‘hard slog’ because we just don’t want to do it. Could it be that you’ve subconsciously underestimated the impact the task could have on your learning? Only keep the task in ‘hard slogs’ if you’re super-sure. It’s worth using this grid throughout May and June just to check in with yourself, work out what you could be doing and picking off those tasks which will have the highest impact.

We recently did this with a pupil who was starting to feel very stressed, he was a highly motivated competitive swimmer with a lot of commitments. His original timetable is shown below: It became very clear why he was feeling stressed – he literally didn’t have a spare minute! To find additional time to get on top of his school work, the only option would have been for him to sleep less (not something we would recommend!). It was apparent that he was committed to too many activities: he was training 7 times a week, including competitions most Saturday's, he also volunteered at a kids activity sessions and was working for his uncle in his shop for eight hours over the weekend He was clearly going to burn out before he got to Christmas! After speaking to him we helped to re-design his timetable After discussing his priorities it became clear that swimming was very important to him, he was close to his national time and didn't want to reduce his training. The extra work with his uncle gave him money but he realised that he needed to scale that back now.

There are a number of people who think that their talent is average, but their work ethic separates them from the rest. The actor Will Smith is a great example of someone who claims he doesn’t have much talent and it’s his work ethic that separates him from the rest. Here’s what he says about hard work: \"The only thing that I see that is distinctly diferent about me is I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period.You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things – you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there’s two things: you’re getting of frst or I’m going to die. It’s really that simple, right?\" The effort thermometer is a way of getting you to keep track of how hard you’re working. The frst thing you have to decide is what are high levels of effort. It might be best if you do this activity with your tutor group or ask few a friends for their thoughts. Next to ‘high effort’ write down what the high effort pupils are doing. (We’ve done this activity a number of times before. Here are the kinds of things we often get back: Does 10 hours of revision each week, Always stays focused in class Works hard in every lesson Does additional work on top of homework Asks teachers questions to fix misunderstandings Attends lunchtime sessions or after-school catch-ups Next, you then need to do the same for average effort and low efort pupils. How are the behaviours in these categories diferent?",

Instead of thinking “This is how hard I’m going to have to work for the rest of the year!”, which can be a daunting prospect, you might instead set yourself a date where you take a mini-break. Try working harder for three or four days before rewarding yourself. Then work for five days at a new level of efort. Then eight or nine. Try for longer and longer periods, building in breaks. These mini-breaks help break-up the time ahead of you and keep you motivated Watch Will Smith's motivational talk below:",

We all experience something called decision fatigue – a decrease in the quality of our decisions over a long period of decision making. (That’s why those decisions we make at 10pm after a full day at school might not be our best!) It’s partly because we often spend a lot of our decision making energy throughout the day on small material decisions – whether to buy this chocolate or that chocolate, what to eat for lunch and where to sit, how to spend a small amount of money, which bus to catch home and so on. Often, our material decisions have taken up a lot of mental energy, leaving our behavioural decisions as unplanned reactions. So when a teacher challenges the quality of your homework, it feels unexpected and you might get angry even though you know you shouldn’t. Or a friend asks you to skip an after-school class and you blurt out, ‘Yes!’ even though you know it’s a bad idea. This activity allows you to anticipate some of those decisions and to ‘pre-make’ them. Use the decision making energy you’ve got now to plan out responses to future events, and make decisions now that represent the best possible future you. First, consider these questions and use the space below to answer them: What kind of person do you want to be? What qualities do you want to have? What’s important to you? What do you want other people to say about you? What ideals do you want your strong, confident decisions to be based on?",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 We’ve worked with thousands of pupils who are great at designing revision; they create amazing revision and independent work plans that fill every minute of the day, but then just don’t follow through on the plan. It’s something we’ve all done; if you have too, don’t beat yourself up about it. Why do we procrastinate? Why do we avoid putting the efort in? This might surprise you, but saying that you are going to do some ‘independent work’ or ‘revision’ is actually part of the problem. When you say that you are going to revise (as far as your brain is concerned), it’s vague and ambiguous. When your brain thinks that you are about to do something that’s vague and ambiguous it will often start to come up with reasons why you shouldn’t do it (which can be quite useful). This probably sounds a bit odd, but your brain starts thinking that this isn’t really a well thought-out plan. It’s not sure what you are going to be doing, or how, and your brain starts to get you thinking that it might not even work. Then you procrastinate. So how do you get past this? It’s quite a simple strategy but we promise you it works. You have to get specifc. Here’s how. Before every independent work session or revision session you have to sit down and answer these three questions: How am I going to revise/work? Here you have to be specifc about the how (what strategy you are going to use) and also what you are going to revise. This means identifying specifcally the topics you are going to cover, and the activities you’re going to do to cover the work How long am I going to revise/work for? Be very clear about the time. If you are doing active revision this shouldn’t be any longer than two hours.Remember to build in short (ten minute) breaks every forty minutes. Use 25 minute sprints (page xx) to help structure sessions, and it becomes even easier to beat procrastination. How will I know if I’ve made progress? How are you going to test yourself? If you just sit for two hours passively reading your notes you will have no idea if you have made any progress, so you’ll need to test yourself in some way. It might be a set of questions you answer, a mini-lecture that you give to yourself, or a short-answer questions you’re going to do under timed conditions towards the end of the session. This activity begins the process of building this into a habit whenever you revise.",

Watch out for sessions that feel too straightforward and too easy. Often they’re the result of planning an activity that isn’t very challenging, and that is quite simple and often pretty boring to complete. When you’re working, try asking yourself, “Would my strictest teachers let me get away with doing this for an hour?” If the answer is “No,” it might be that you need to step up the challenge a little.

      "field_1293_raw": "<hr /><h2 style=\"text-align:center;margin:0px;color:#a4c2f4;\"><strong>LEARN 💡</strong></h2><hr /><p><br /><img src=\"https://www.vespa.academy/assets/MVIMAGES/revision1.jpg\" />We’ve worked with thousands of pupils who are great at designing revision; they create amazing revision and independent work plans that fill every minute of the day, but then just don’t follow through on the plan.<br />\n</p><p>It’s something we’ve all done; if you have too, don’t beat yourself up about it. Why do we procrastinate? Why do we avoid putting the efort in?\n</p><p>This might surprise you, but saying that you are going to do some<strong><em> ‘independent work’</em></strong> or <strong><em>‘revision’ </em></strong>is actually part of the problem. When you say that you are going to revise (as far as your brain is concerned), it’s vague and ambiguous. When your brain thinks that you are about to do something that’s vague and ambiguous it will often start to come up with reasons why you shouldn’t do it (which can be quite useful). This probably sounds a bit odd, but your brain starts thinking that this isn’t really a well thought-out plan. It’s not sure what you are going to be doing, or how, and your brain starts to get you thinking that it might not even work. Then you procrastinate.\n</p><h5><strong><em>So how do you get past this?</em></strong></h5><p>It’s quite a simple strategy but we promise you it works. You have to get specifc. Here’s how. Before every independent work session or revision session you have to sit down and answer these three questions:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><strong><em>How am I going to revise/work?</em></strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Here you have to be specifc about the how (what strategy you are going to use) and also what you are going to revise. This means identifying specifcally the topics you are going to cover, and the activities you’re going to do to cover the work</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li><strong><em>How long am I going to revise/work for?</em></strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Be very clear about the time.

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Sometimes facing the reality of a situation can seem daunting. We all hide from the facts sometimes – we know something needs changing but it can seem easier just not to make the change. Here’s a good metaphor for exploring this further. Have you ever wandered down a beach and lifted up some rocks? It can be quite scary but good fun. You never quite know what you are going to fnd. To begin with there seems to be no sign of life. Then you lift a rock and all sorts of squidgy creatures come out – little worms, crabs, snails, sea anemones or even the odd fish. More often than not people put the rock back down and move on, preferring not to spend too much time looking at what’s underneath. But sometimes in life we have to look under the rocks to make progress. This technique is used a lot in business. A researcher and writer called Jim Collins, in his book Good to Great ,found that all successful companies face the brutal facts of reality, looking under the rocks for problems, even when they don’t want to! This activity is going to feel uncomfortable but by the end of it you will have a plan to make things better. The Steps: Step 1 - Identify any issues you think are under the rocks. This means taking some time and being really, brutally honest with yourself. Step 2 - The second step requires a group of four good, trusted, friends. Position yourself so that you are facing the group. You are then going to share your issue for change and the rest of the group are going to ask you questions and maybe ofer some solutions. Listen carefully during this feedback. We quite often think that we can’t change something simply because we have run out of ideas.Now you’ve had a long, critical look at your progress you might be feeling pretty bruised. Take a break, go for a walk, watch TV, treat yourself to ice cream. Once you have, it’s time for the third step: Step 3 - Taking action. What exactly can you do to improve matters? You might know all about origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. Those who do it can make beautiful and complex 3D models, many of which look incredible and even have moving parts. Despite these amazing constructions, the process is just a series of simple steps repeated over and over again. Every origami masterpiece begins with a single fold in a piece of paper, followed by another and another and another. It’s the same with academic learning. Sometimes we might look at a pupil who’s way ahead of us and think they’ve achieved something impossible. But remember: all that pupil has done is execute a repeated series of steps over and over again. The following activity is all about practical steps you can take to improve.",

Pupils who have the efort habit have created a weekly routine of repeated activities that allow them to respond to teacher requests (homework) and reinforce learning (independent work). Pupils without the efort habit have little or no routine and respond to work as and when it hits them. Increasing your levels of effort can be a tiring task because it means moving away from a comfortable and familiar way of working into a less comfortable one. So rewarding yourself for increased levels of effort is hugely important. Parents and teachers might not spot the change in your work patterns right away, so it will be up to you to give yourself a pat on the back. That’s where mission and medal comes in: the mission is the work, the medal is the reward! This activity helps you to design and structure an effortful week of work that you can then repeat until it becomes a routine. Pretty soon you won’t be the only person rewarding yourself – teachers, tutors and parents will spot your new routine and you’ll be in line for some praise! Step 1: Audit of a typical week. Before you design your mission and medal week, you need to figure out what’s currently happening. In the boxes on the following page, record what you do with your time during a typical week. Step 2: Create a Mission and Medal Week For five of the seven days, set yourself a sixty-minute mission. It could be one of the following: Complete homework, Plan ahead, Consolidate learning, Organise notes, Research sixth form colleges, Fill out an application Begin a revision guide. Complete the mission all at once or in parts. Choose times of day when you work well – without distractions. For the same five days, set aside a medal to be awarded on completion of the mission. It might be a session on your games console, a TV programme, a football match, some time on social media, something nice to eat or drink or some favourite music. Vary your medals. Don’t forget to assign yourself two bonus medals – a mid-weeker to pep you up and a Sunday-nighter to get you feeling good for the week. These medals should be a little larger than your regular medals. Step 3 - Building a Scoreboard There’s a lot of conflicting research about how long it takes to create a habit. Unless you keep track you’ll have no idea. Now you’ve devised a mission and medal week, you can use a scoreboard as a simple way of helping you with motivation. We developed this idea after hearing the American comedian Jerry Seinfeld talk about how he writes jokes. He sets himself the goal of writing a joke every day and keeps a diary to check off when he’s been successful. His argument is that once you see the days being ticked off, you don’t want to see the pattern being broken, so you keep going. After a few weeks, this new behaviour just becomes a habit and you might not even need to think about it – you just do it! So, for every day you follow your mission and medal programme, you simply tick off the days. You’ll need a monthly calendar like the one below. Use the following activity to aufid your week and commit to trying a new, mission and medal week soon.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 There’s a very famous book by Italian entrepreneur and author Francesco Cirillo called The Pomodoro Technique . Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. (The tomato in question is one of those novelty kitchen timers, not a real one!) We’ll come back to the tomato in a bit. In his book, Cirillo argues that we can generate lots of energy and efort by working in short bursts, even on long tasks that we don’t feel motivated to do. Think of all the tasks you’ve got to do that you just can’t bear to begin – there might be revision notes, essays to write, jumbled notes to fle away or a piece of coursework to start. Choose one that’s become a bit of a nightmare for you – that’s hanging over your head and you just don’t want to do. Make a note of it first. Step 1 Now for the tomato. By which we mean getting hold of either a kitchen timer (needless to say, it doesn’t have to be shaped like anything in particular!) or the timer on your phone. Find somewhere quiet. Arrange the things you need to begin. You’re going to do a twenty-fve minute sprint. It’s important to tell yourself this: twenty-fve minutes – that’s all. You’re allowed no distractions whatsoever in that twenty-fve minutes. Don’t worry. You can be back on social media in twenty-fve minutes’ time, checking updates and messages. Now start the timer and go! Step 2 Congratulations! You’ve got that nightmare task started. All of a sudden, this job is going to seem less frightening. You’ll be able to come back to it. Some suggestions for messing around with the Pomodoro Technique: The ‘Quick Sprint’: try twenty-fve minutes on, twenty-fve minutes of, twenty-fve minutes on. It takes one hour and ffteen minutes in total, and you can do it at a regular time each night after school. The ‘Serious Sprint’. Try twenty-fve minutes on, fve minutes of, twenty-fve minutes on, fve minutes of, twenty-fve minutes on. It takes about one hour and thirty minutes, and is a useful technique for really attacking a difcult piece of work. Try measuring tasks in sprints. How many will it take? This way, you’ll develop a sense of how you work, and you can begin picking of scary tasks more quickly and easily. Try using sprints to review work. Suddenly you’ll fnd yourself ahead and on top of things. It’s a great feeling If you are ready to try 25min Sprint nowm use the following activity.",

He is also the author of the ‘Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul’ series which we highly recommend. Canfeld employs the useful analogy of chopping down a tree when trying to achieve your goals. He says that if you take a very sharp axe and take fve swings at a tree every day, no matter how big the tree, eventually it will come down. It’s the same with any goal you set. If you take a few small steps every month towards achieving your goal, eventually you’ll get there, no matter how big the goal. Canfeld almost makes it sound inevitable. It makes you think: the reason people don’t achieve their dreams isn’t that they lack a dream, it’s that they just don’t take any action. A dream is just a dream unless you take action! This activity might seem simple, but we guarantee it’s one of the most efective tools we have ever used. All you have to do is take three steps every half-term towards achieving your long-term goal. It’s that simple. You have to decide the steps you are going to take and then commit to doing them.",

Designing a success map can really help with this. A success map is a visual reminder of the journey you’re going on. It guides you to where you want to be and warns you about things that might pull you of course. Look at how this university student has used a dotted line to indicate the journey of her boat between the islands in this version of her jourrney to success map: There are two main elements here – the positive and the negative. Have a look at how the student emphasises positive things that are going to help: ‘Peaceful Bay’, ‘Exercise’, ‘Up Early!’, ‘Mind Maps’ and ‘ Tutors to the Rescue!’ And hazards to watch out for: ‘Loss of Focus’, ‘Sharks of Disillusionment’ and ‘ Sea Monsters of Personal Disaster’. You can do the same on your map: Mapping your support - Surround your pathway with good things that will encourage and help you. Rewards, celebrations and holidays all need marking on the map. Think about the people who might support you too. Could you ask friends, a mentor or your parents/guardian? Write the names of these people in your ‘support team’ box. Mapping your challenges. Here you should include the things you’re going to need to watch out for. They should be specifc to you – your bad habits! It might be laziness, procrastination, worry or distraction. Unlike the example above, we’ve found it useful to add dates to the map so you know what happens when in the year ahead. Once done, it’s a good idea to keep your map on display somewhere that you can always see it. This will help to remind you of the steps that need to be completed to reach that destination in the distance! Use the following activity to help plan out yoursuccess roadmap",

What if it wasn’t so bad?\" The obstacle is the way, Ryan Holiday (2015 ) Deciding what your goals are and making a plan can, quite often, be the easy bit. We usually set of with good intentions and then boom, we get hit with an obstacle or a number of obstacles that slow us down or in some cases stop us from following through on our goals. The frst thing to remember is that this is completely normal. As Ryan Holiday says in the quote above, if you have a goal worth pursuing it’s likely that there are going to be some obstacles on the route. So don’t beat yourself up about it. Accept this as part of the journey and plan a way through – it might not be that bad! Sometimes these obstacles can be completely out of our control – a sudden change of circumstances in our life such as illness or family problems, for example. However, we sometimes think that these obstacles are out of our control when in fact we might be able to do something about them. This activity is one to do if you fnd that you’re not making the progress you hoped for.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Entrepreneur Derek Silvers argues that to have a single, specific goal in mind can be limiting – because if obstacles keep cropping up to stop us, we eventually abandon this single, specific goal. Instead of a specific goal, he argues that we should spend our lives pursuing the answer to a problem. That’s our purpose in life. This is a better way to goal set because even when obstacles block our way, we find another route towards solving our chosen problem – of pursuing our purpose. For example, here are two pretty similar pupils: Pupil 1 has a super-specific goal : I want to study medicine at Manchester University and become a doctor. Pupil 2 has a problem that fascinates them : how can we improve healthcare in the UK? Of course, each pupil will encounter obstacles along their way. But if pupil 1 doesn’t get the grades to study medicine at Manchester, the route to their goal is blocked. If the same thing happens to pupil 2, they will find a different route to solving the problem that fascinates them; they may do voluntary work, start a nursing course, choose a degree that covers public healthcare systems or research the politics of healthcare. Silvers says that if we can express our goals as problems we’re trying to solve, we always know when we’re heading in the right direction and we tend not to be put of by obstacles. Let’s build a compass. Your true north is the problem that most fascinates you – the one you should always be heading towards. Let’s call this your lead problem. Around true north (north-east, north-west) are other problems that are close to your lead problem – perhaps different versions of your lead problem. If you’re heading in this direction you’re still doing OK. Around the other compass points (east, south and west) are distractions – things you shouldn’t be pursuing, even if other people think you should. If you’re going in these directions, you'll need to turn back Cover the compass points with notes. Problems that interest or fascinate you go at or near your true north. Distractions go elsewhere, with the biggest at the south – the opposite direction to your true north. Example problems to consider, discuss or discard include: How do we make the distribution of wealth in the UK fairer? How can we save larger numbers of species from extinction? How might we design buildings that increase people’s happiness and well-being? What are the elements necessary for a superb movie? How can we improve pupils’ experience of school, college or university? How can the design of ______ be improved? How can we accelerate our progress towards curing ______? How can art be used to improve people’s lives? What qualities are necessary for huge success in ______? How can I create popular, immersive, interactive computer games? How can we reduce crime by working with young offenders? What qualities make some ______ better than others? How can we help people cope with difficult, stressful or traumatic times in their lives? What does outstanding parenting/teaching look like? How can we discover more about the workings of the universe? How do we solve global warming? What does augmented/virtual reality mean for media/entertainment/gaming? How can we work more efficiently using artificial intelligence?

Order : the need for organised, stable, predictable environments; creating routines and patterns. Physical activity: the need for movement, exercise and physical challenge. Power : the need for influence, the ability to determine the direction of others; the responsibility for the performance of groups. Saving : the need to collect things, to own things and categorise or order them. Social contact: the need for friends, to have extensive peer relationships.

It’s crazy that we don’t spend more time learning from people who have already been through what we would like to do and learning from their mistakes. The message is that we don’t have to make the same mistakes! So what did they do? This activity involves you speaking to a pupil who has already done well in their GCSEs and maybe some pupils who didn’t. This might be something that your teacher can arrange for you or you might be able to ask a friend’s older brother or sister. You'll need about fifteen minutes to do this activity. It might feel a bit awkward, but just think of yourself as a journalist trying to find out a story of success. Below is the famous talk by Jim Rohn, which gave this activity its title:",

It’s a balancing exercise that frees up the mind and lets you make sense of hundreds of competing thoughts, ideas, worries and fears. So, if you’re in a muddle, if you’re struggling to feel positive or if you’re feeling gloomy, this one might work for you. The human brain works more effectively with good blood flow, so walking is essential to this activity. After your walk, you will need half an hour to collect your thoughts, jotting things down and making notes. Alternatively, you can use the voice recorder on a mobile phone to record your thoughts and ideas as you go. For this activity to work, you need to be disciplined and follow the following rules to the letter! Instructions Block out an hour of your time. You must be alone and undisturbed for this hour. Choose a destination that is about twenty minutes’ walk away. While you walk there, you can only think positive thoughts. Your topic is: \"things I am good at and things I am thankful for.\" Nothing else can enter your mind. Bully yourself into staying on these two topics. Record your thoughts or list them quickly on a notepad.Then turnaround and return to your start point. While you walk back, you can address the problems you think you have, but here is the rule – your topic is: \" things I can do to solve my problems.\" Be strong with yourself. This is the only thing you can think about. When you arrive back, take a few minutes alone and make a note of your thoughts and ideas. A final thought: worry is a call to action. If you’re worrying, make a list of actions and then act on what you have listed. If you don’t change things, things don’t change.",

In essence, he argues that those who surround themselves with good people become good – those who surround themselves with hard working people become hard working. Equally, those who surround themselves with lazy people become lazy. This is something we see every year: promising students who have a friendship group which almost enforces disengagement. The group will effectively mock or punish any group member who is enjoying study, succeeding or working hard. It’s sometimes difficult to tell if it’s happening to you, and by the time you’ve figured it out it can be too late. The Vampire Test Writer and artist Austin Kleon has a solution. He calls it the Vampire Test, and he explains it in his book, \"Show your Work!\" Kleon advises that; ‘ if, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire’ (2014, p. 129). Watch the video below to learn more about the Vampre Test:",

Kübler-Ross proposed that a terminally ill patient would progress through certain stages of grief when informed of their illness. Nowadays, the curve is used to help people understand their reactions to significant change in their lives. Starting Post 16 study is a significant change in any student’s life and, like any change, it’s likely that you will experience some of the following feelings. Application of Change curve to the transition fromn Key Stage 4 to Key Stage 5: Think about your responses at Level 3. We’ve heard things like this: Rejection: ‘I don’t believe what you’re telling me about Level 3study. It doesn’t seem any different.I’ll carry on as normal.’ Denial/minimisation: ‘I’m fine. It’ll be alright. Stop hassling me about how different it is.’ Anger: ‘I actually hate this. The teachers are rubbish. The subjects are nothing like they said they would be. I wish I’d never started or gone to that other college.’ Blame self: ‘It turns out I’m just not clever enough to do this.’ Anxiety: ‘Everyone else is better than me. I’m missing deadlines. I’m not sleeping well. I don’t understand the work. I’m not enjoying this challenge at all. I’m scared I’ll fail.’ Emotional fog: Withdrawing effort. Giving up. Acceptance/letting go: ‘Things are different now. It’s hard, but I’m getting to grips with it.’ Experiment/consolidate/get on with it: ‘I’m getting better at this.

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Imagine the following experiment: Two groups of students are set the same task: They are asked to throw a rolled-up ball of paper into a bin from three yards. They all know they have to practise and that they will be tested on the number of successful throws they achieve at the end of the practice period. Here’s the interesting bit: Group 1 - are told to repeat three yard throws over and over again Group 2 - are made to alternate between two yard and four yard throws over and over again. Group 1 is employing M echanical Practice ; they’re doing the same thing over and over again. Group 2 are employing Flexible Practice ;They are mixing up their practice a bit The first group might quickly get better at three yard throws, of course. But what happens if the position of the bin is adjusted to three-and-a-half yards? Or four yards? Now the second group are in a better position because they’ve practised differently – more flexibly. What Does This Mean for your Study? The throws are like exam questions or assessments. Some students prepare for ‘standard assessments’ only. They’re great at these predictable questions – like three yard throws. But if the exam or assessment asks something slightly different, they’re in trouble. They can have nightmare exam experiences. They will often say, ‘The question was slightly different! It totally messed with my concentration! I didn’t know what to do!’ Students who practise flexibly start to think flexibly. They will say, ‘ The questions were a bit weird. Eventually I worked out what I needed to do though.’ So make sure you mix it up in practice. Researchers call this ‘interleaved practice’ ; practice that forces you to switch tasks regularly. It’s slower to begin with, but the long-term benefits are that you become flexible in your thinking, and you can handle unexpected questions. So why not challenge yourself to: Seek out the weirdest questions that have ever come up and try them. Create your own strange questions. Visit the website of a different exam board and try their questions instead. The following activity is about starting this research now and starting to think about some curveball questions for yourself........",

But challenging, flexible practice will mean you can cope. We always fondly remember an ace mathematician we worked with. On the day of his final exam he was supremely confident – convinced there wasn’t a curveball he hadn’t already seen. And he was right; he didn’t drop a single mark. Afterwards, when we interviewed him, it turned out the exam he’d just taken was the fifteenth paper he’d completed under timed conditions in the fortnight before the exam. You too can be that well prepared!",

It’s slower to begin with, but the long-term benefits are that you become flexible in your thinking, and you can handle unexpected questions.\n</p><p>So why not challenge yourself to:\n</p><ul><li>Seek out the weirdest questions that have ever come up and try them.</li><li>Create your own strange questions.</li><li>Visit the website of a different exam board and try their questions instead.</li></ul>The following activity is about starting this research now and starting to think about some curveball questions for yourself........<br />",

Once you do know, you can put them into a target diagram like the one below. Target diagrams like this are used by sports psychologists when working with athletes. The slice of the target diagram is coloured in depending on how confident and practised you feel with a particular skill – a fully coloured in slice for a skill that you feel is fully developed and a totally empty slice for a skill that needs a lot of work. Below is an example using the topic areas from a Science A Level as the different \"Skills\": The first image shows each of the different requirements of the course, some similar areas have been combined if the skills are similar or related. The second image shows the completed target diagram, showing the strengths and areas of improvement: Meet your teachers and ask them, ‘What are the seven skills I need to master to get an A?’ Read your syllabuses and look at the assessment objectives (AOs), which are the skills the examiner is looking for. Mark schemes will offer you a description of those skills too. Examiner’s reports will outline the skills students are executing well, and what they tend to do badly. Once you think you’ve got the skills, see if you can sum up each of them in a concise sentence to make sure you’ve really understood them.",

Then analyse what is missing from your work. Focus on things you need to ‘do more of’ and things you need to ‘do less of’. Find a student you know who executes a particular skill better than you do, - work alongside them, watching how they do it. Move quickly in and out of exam conditions, practising your skills in bursts. - Rather than do a complete exam paper over two hours, find a handful of questions, work out how long you’d need to complete them if they were part of an exam (twelve minutes, say, or fifteen) and take yourself into exam conditions for that amount of time.

Instead, a single skill is focused on and repeated. After some time working on a drill, players might then play a game in which the particular skill is tested.\n</p><p>Does this work with study too? With a maths problem or a history essay? The answer is yes.\n</p><h4><strong>\n</strong>\n<ol><strong></strong>\n</ol><strong>1. Go slow.</strong></h4>To begin with you should try the equivalent of a drill. You’re taking out the stress, worry and complexity, so you’re not thinking about the chaos and uncertainty of doing an exam. You’re going slowly, paying attention to what you do. That might mean taking half an hour to work through a short answer exam question, twenty minutes on a maths problem, an hour on a couple of science questions or half an hour writing a single killer paragraph for an essay.<p><br />\n</p><h4><strong>2. Go fast.<br /></strong></h4>Then you can try to apply the learning in a ‘game’ situation – in other words, under exam conditions. Pick an exam question, work out how long you would have in the exam and see whether you can perform at the same level but under the pressure of time.<br />",

That’s you being active, engaging with information and reorganising it so it becomes knowledge.\n</p><p>Alternatively you can use complex graphic organisers. They usually take the form of a metaphor, where you turn something into something else.\n</p><p>For example, summarise everything you know about a topic using the metaphor of a tree.\n</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:rgb(128, 100, 162);\">TREE GRAPHIC ORGANISER:</span></strong>\n</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://upskillnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/root-cause-analysis.png\" />\n</p>",

It might be a complex mathematical problem worked through, a definition and example question in social science, a perfect paragraph or a calculation in chemistry or physics. Once you’ve got the example, you can do the following activity. We’ve found it works well at helping students see the difference between a successful answer and unsuccessful answer by making you focus on the differences between wrong and right. The principle is very simple. It goes like this: Using your example, copy the skill - You must do it right. It might be that you write a paragraph that borrows the best bits from the example you’ve got, or you might solve a very similar mathematical problem following your example. Then do it wron g. Do it the way you’ve been doing it. - Examine the differences. Where exactly do you go wrong? What is the result of that error? Where does it lead? How does wrong look different? Then copy the skill right again. - You go – right, wrong, right. The two rights start to burn the understanding into your brain. The wrong in the middle helps you see why the wrong is wrong.

It’s based on using flash cards to learn and then recall information, so this activity will need a whole bunch of subject-related flash cards. The cards are used as normal to record quick, easy-to-read bullet-pointed information about topics. Leitner suggests that when we have a large amount of information to learn on flash cards, we have a tendency to gravitate towards the cards we already know and subconsciously avoid those we find difficult. To circumvent this, you create four subsections in your box (or four separate boxes): Box 1. - Here you put items for frequent practice. This is the stuff you’re not remembering well – it needs regular review and rereading because you’re making mistakes when you practise recalling it or you don’t know it at all. Around 40% of your time should be spent hammering the content of these cards.When you score a victory and fully recall a card, you move it down to box 2. Box 2. - About 30% of your time is spent here. It’s the stuff you’ve only just moved out of box 1 or learning that still trips you up or confuses you in any way. This material should be moving up (if you’re not remembering it) or down (if you’ve nailed it) fairly regularly. Box 3. - You spend 20% of your time here, and you nearly always get this stuff correct when you test yourself on it. You feel confident, even when the material is complex. However, if you dip in here and make any mistakes in recall at all, the card must be moved into box 2. Box 4. - You begin with only a small number of cards here. This is the material you consider easy. You always get it right, so you only need to spend 10% of your time checking stuff in this box. However, and this is key, nothing ever leaves this box because you know it so well. No matter how confident you feel, you still check it every now and again.

It’s based on using flash cards to learn and then recall information, so this activity will need a whole bunch of subject-related flash cards. The cards are used as normal to record quick, easy-to-read bullet-pointed information about topics.</p><p>Leitner suggests that when we have a large amount of information to learn on flash cards, we have a tendency to gravitate towards the cards we already know and subconsciously avoid those we find difficult. To circumvent this, you create four subsections in your box (or four separate boxes):\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Box 1.</strong> - <em>Here you put items for frequent practice.

Now try our Revision Questionnaire in the link below, remembering to make a note of your scores. VESPA REVISION QUESTIONNAIRE When you have taken the questionnaire will notice that the revision activities have been placed into 3 categories: Content Techniques Skill Techniques Feedback Techniques Notice in our example that student 1 only does content revision, while student 2 does all three stages and then takes some time off. In our experience, student 2 will pretty much always get a better grade than student 1. And they put in fewer hours. Make sure you do some revision for each of C, S and F ! Aim for three of each; nine methods in total. We’ve found that students who get the best results practise in a wider variety of ways. Our top performers had over ten ticks in the always column, and these were evenly spread across C, S and F. However, students who worse results had far fewer ticks in the always column – often only four or five. They were very restricted in the way they practised, often spending hours repeating the same limited range of activities. Aim to increase the ticks in your always column to ten.",

This is crucial: how big is the job ahead of you? Surprisingly, lots of students never really get to grips with what they need to know. Second is the TIME FRAME - You need to consider two things here: when is the deadline for the project, and how many hours will you need to complete it? Thinking in terms of hours will give you a much clearer idea when it comes to scheduling the project. Third is QUALITY - Not only do you have to consider the standards you want to achieve, but you also need to know the criteria you are working towards. What exactly do you have to do to meet the standards? Write these down in this box. Finally, RESOURCES - this is a list of everything you will need to complete the project. Which can also include people – for example, you might have to meet certain teachers to discuss the requirements of the exam.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 This is a simple system of time management. It’s based on the idea of a long-term project being like a bridge. Imagine a bridge built over a wide valley. What kind of bridge are you imagining? We would bet it has vertical piers holding it up. That’s because everyone knows that something which spans a long distance needs regular structure to support it. Now imagine that bridge as a long-term project – an essay that needs to be handed in to your teacher in two weeks or a coursework project that needs to be submitted in three months. The project is a long-term, long-distance project, so it needs a regular structure to support it. The 2–4–8 rule helps you build that solid structure, like vertical piers supporting a bridge. 1. The Short-Term Project: ‘You’ve got two weeks to complete this’ Many teachers might give you two weeks to complete a project. Here’s how to use the 2–4–8 rule to respond: Target 1: Two days - Make a note of what you would like to achieve to get the project started – a side of writing, three hours of reading, some research, organising your notes or planning your piece. Set yourself a target of two days to complete this work. Target 2: Four days later - Make a note of where you want to be four days after that. Halfway through would be a sensible plan. Break the back of the task – get through the hard bit. Target 3: eight days later - You’re handing in the assignment today. It needs to be complete. Make sure you’ve finished early, gone through it and made any adjustments. 2. The Long -Term Project: ‘This needs finishing by March’ Often coursework submissions come with more extended deadlines like this. If your deadline is a longer one, it’s worth working backwards from targets like this: Target 3: eight months until submission - In these early stages, you should be finding an example of what you’re trying to achieve – for example, another student’s coursework submission. Look it over and say to yourself, ‘I want mine to look like this.’ Make a list of what needs to be done by the end of the project. Get started on rough, early versions or drafts. Target 2: four months until submission. - Make notes of where you would like to be halfway through assuming it’s going really well. By now you will have been working on early versions and fleshing them out. How many sections will be complete in rough form by this point? What will your word count be (if it’s a written task)? What reading and research will you have done and incorporated by this point? What standard will you have achieved? Target 1: Two months until submission - If you’ve met your targets up to this point, you’ll know very clearly what needs to be done to complete the project, and you can begin the final stages of the project in earnest. What groundwork do you still need to do? What reading needs to be completed? What notes do you still need to take and incorporate? How many words are left? How do you conclude and reference?",

Halfway through would be a sensible plan. Break the back of the task – get through the hard bit.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Target 3: eight days later - </strong>You’re handing in the assignment today.

Look it over and say to yourself, ‘I want mine to look like this.’ Make a list of what needs to be done by the end of the project. Get started on rough, early versions or drafts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Target 2: four months until submission. -</strong> Make notes of where you would like to be halfway through assuming it’s going really well.

Not straightaway – it needs time to get up to speed. But then it hits a sweet spot when it’s really firing. Brain efficiency can vary, she says, but in the morning it can be up to 30% more active and sharp than it is at other times. Here’s something else to consider: the longer the day goes on, the more self-control problems you will have. If you’re trying to give up chocolate, for example, you will rarely crack at 10 a.m. But by 4.30 p.m., when you’re feeling tired, your self-control slips. It’s the same with work. If you tell yourself you will start a big project at 3 p.m. or 6 p.m., the chances of that happening are low. If you set aside some ‘breakfast club’ time – sweet spot time in the morning – you’re much more likely to clear the job. And yet we often see students using a morning study period to ease themselves into the day. They waste their moments of high brain energy on social media and gaming, then turn their attention to work later on when they’re not as productive. Your morning mood dictates how productive you will be for the rest of the day. Start everyday right with these proven morning routine tips!",

Even when our to-do list seems huge and overwhelming, as long as we know what’s next, we’re often OK. It means we can ignore the big picture for a little while and just concentrate on the next thing on the energy line. Consider the following possibilities: Are you burying an important job lower down the line – one you really need to get done? What is the one item on the list that you’re dreading the most ... and is there a way you could get it started right now? Could you take a task you’re reluctant to start and replace it with three smaller jobs – the beginning, middle and end of the bigger task? You’ll have more jobs on your Energy Line, but they’ll each be easier to complete. Try estimating the time it would take to complete each item on your list and write this next to the task.Then add up all the tasks and see how much time you’ve predicted this will take in total. You might be surprised – it might be four or five hours when you thought it would take much longer! Each time you complete a task, consider transferring it to a ‘done’ list.

Some people have got the effort habit, some people haven’t. The argument goes that there are three elements to habit formation, often referred to as the three R’s: The Reminder. This could be a feeling, a place or a time of day – it’s your body or brain giving you a trigger that initiates the behaviour. It might be getting some chocolate, going home early or putting away the work you know you should be completing. The Routine. This is the behaviour itself. Going to the canteen and buying the chocolate or taking the bus home instead of staying on to do some studying. Often people will feel a twinge of guilt during the routine but do it anyway. The Reward. This is the good feeling you get – the benefit you gain from engaging in the behaviour. It might not last long but it is a tempting prospect. If you haven’t currently got into the effort habit, how can you go about changing? You can use the three R’s in your favour. Rather than thinking about stopping old habits – which is a mistake many people make when ‘giving up’ something – the trick is to think of it as starting a new habit. This means you will need a new reminder to trigger your new habit, a new routine to go through and, best of all, a new reward to give yourself!",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 Professor Peter Gollwitzer of New York University says that many people who want to put their efforts into achieving great things, but don’t, are derailed by seemingly small problems like these: They want to finish a task to a high standard, but a phone call disrupts them. They want to complete a coursework piece, but the weekend is just too busy. They want to do some serious revision, but some friends disturb them and the work is abandoned. In their book The Psychology of Action (1996) , Peter Gollwitzer and John Bargh argue that if this happens to you, it’s because you have low ‘implementation intention’ – you sort of want to put in the effort, but you will be easily put off if one thing goes wrong. The solution? Successful students anticipate these problems and plan for how they will respond to them with maximum effort. You sequence actions that anticipate obstacles and build in pre-prepared solutions – you effectively beat self-sabotage before it even happens. Consider these examples: Student 1: ‘I’ll get started on this first thing in the morning.’ This is a really common internal dialogue you might experience as a student – lots do it! And with one small disruption the whole plan comes to a standstill. Student 2: ‘I’ll get started on this first thing in the morning. And ... If I wake up late by accident, then I’ll use my morning break to start it instead and ...’ If I feel really demotivated, then I’ll get two coffees from the canteen and drink them quickly to give me a boost and ...’ If I get disturbed by friends, then I’ll make an excuse and go to the library and ...’ If the internet is down, then I’ll start by using my class notes and save the research work until later.’ It’s easy to see which student might be the one most likely to succeed. Student 2 has listed a series of potential problems and has recognised their tendency to self-sabotage when small things go wrong. By planning a change in action when those small obstacles come along, they are much more likely to keep pushing forward. List all the usual blockers you use to prevent high levels of effort and for each one commit to a solution. Think them all through in your head and make notes. What you are doing is strengthening your implementation intention . You will put the effort in, even if small things crop up to stop you.",

        "text": "LEARN 💡 In \"Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives (2015)\", Gretchen Rubin, a lawyer and writer, says that the language we use to describe ourselves – our ‘inner storytelling’ – massively influences the amount of effort we put into a project. Rubin argues that ‘we tend to believe what we hear ourselves say, and the way we describe ourselves influences our view of identity’ (2015, p. 225). Perhaps this describes you – maybe you’ve told yourself these stories for years. Inner storytelling helps us live up to our own hopes and fears. This activity lasts for one week, during which time your challenge is to change your inner storytelling. This, in turn, could change your patterns of behaviour, your habits and, ultimately, the effort you put into your work. A good place to start would be to choose one of the following stories to tell about yourself: When I started my Level 3 course(s), I suddenly became a hard-worker. I battle. I give 100% whatever I do. I never give up. When I say I’ll do something, I do it. I’ll deliver. I always do. I don’t waste time. I get things done. I’m dedicated and strong under pressure. People can rely on me. When there is a challenging task, I go at it until I’m done. I’m not lazy or flaky. I’m no shirker. Research conducted by Ethan Kross, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, shows that self-talk like this works even better in the second or third person (using the pronoun ‘you’ or your first name instead of ‘I’ ) so you might want to experiment with your language (Kross et al., 2014). Once you’ve chosen your new story, you need to find a method of verbalising it. The word ‘mantra’ is often used to describe an utterance or phrase with psychological power. This is what you’re creating here. Find a time of day when you can repeat your mantra – on the bus, in the shower, walking home or crossing the campus between lessons. Then try it for a week.

His advice is as follows: ‘If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first’ (p.2). This is another way of saying that if you have important tasks to apply your effort to, start with the biggest, hardest and most important one first. This is related to Tim Ferriss’ idea of the ‘lead domino’ (which he talks about in his podcast ‘How to Build a Large Audience From Scratch (And More)’. If you do the tough tasks first, your effort will be worthwhile because it will pay dividends later. So, list all your frog tasks – in order of ugliness!

        "text": "LEARN 💡 A ‘blocker’ is a psychological barrier that stops you working. It might be a pattern of thinking or a habit you’ve established that you can’t break. All of us have blockers – thoughts and feelings that stop us doing the thing we know we really need to do.To put in the effort for Level 3 success you have to recognise your blockers and break down those patterns of thought. This four stage model is useful for recognising the behaviours and thought patterns that are a sign of blockers. 1. Initial Lack of Motivation Everyone feels discouraged at some point – the feeling that they don’t want to complete a piece of work, finish an essay or put in a couple of hours on a tricky piece of coursework. The difference is what you tend to do next. 2. Bypassing Conscience Most people will feel guilty when they don’t work (‘I should be finishing that essay …’), but sometimes we find ways of bypassing our conscience. We deliberately rethink the situation until we feel better about it. Some thought patterns you might have include: Student A hasn’t done it either, so I’m not that bad. At other schools/colleges they don’t even do this piece, so why should I? The instructions were unclear, so I’ve got an excuse. I’m telling myself I didn’t really understand. I rushed a piece last time and the grade was OK. I’ll do that again. I deserve a break. I’ve always really loved this TV programme – I’ll watch it instead. I’m going to do something else that has some ‘educational value’. 3. Creating An Opportunity Next, there needs to be something nearby that can distract you. Some students work near others and tell themselves this is beneficial because they can ask for help if they need it. What they might actually be doing is hoping for a distraction to occur. The same goes for workspaces. Do you work near or next to your phone, laptop, tablet, PS4 console or TV, secretly hoping for something to take you away from your work? If this is you, then you are subconsciously (or maybe deliberately!) creating the opportunity for blocks to occur. 4. Getting Away With It Finally, for the pattern to continue, you need to feel that you have got away with it. The thought pattern here often goes, ‘Nobody said anything, so it must be alright’ or ‘I didn’t get told off, so I’ll do it again.’ This activity might help you recognise your own tendency to self-sabotage. Don’t worry, everyone does it to a certain extent – really productive people have learned to fight the feeling!",

If you feel self-sabotage coming on, move location. Get yourself to a quiet room, a study area or the library. Start the task. You don’t even have to finish it – work for thirty minutes or so – but get it started. You’re less likely to sabotage a project that is already underway!",

Use the scale below and the following guideline to choose your current effort number: 1 - Little or no effort. 5 - Some effort – you’re working quite hard. 10 - High levels of effort – the hardest you’ve worked. Be honest with yourself, choose your number and record it in the box. What Are Other Students Doing? The problem with making a judgement about your own levels of effort is that scales can be subjective. Here are some of the issues: The numbers mean different things to different people. Students tend to surround themselves with people who do either similar or less work than they do. This means they ‘normalise’ the amount of work they are doing, even feel good about it, because they can point to someone doing less than they are. Students don’t have a clear idea of what the hardest working students are doing. No one can know what students are doing in other schools and colleges. The answer is to get some concrete figures so the choice of number is a more accurate reflection of your levels of effort relative to other students. The following activity is about you re-evaluating your current level of effort using an objective scale, rather than just guessing how much effort you are making.",

The key to reaching this level is to set yourself independent study tasks. It might sound crazy but this is what the high effort students we’ve met and interviewed tell us they do. Here are a few examples of these activities: Handing in homework early to get extra feedback. Rescuing a project that’s behind schedule. Asking a teacher five questions to help clarify a problem. Seeking a book/study guide recommendation. Completing a one-hour reread and reorganise of notes on a topic. Sending five emails asking for support, help or advice. Talking through a topic with another student. Borrowing someone else’s notes. Attending a support class or revision session. Handing in an edited piece of work. Reviewing a teacher’s feedback to look for patterns. Tidying resources and summarising a topic on one sheet of A4. You could choose a couple of these to get you started. Just remember one final thing: don’t fall for the myth of the brilliant, talented student who does superbly in every test without putting any effort in.

In her book, Rethinking Positive Thinking (2014), Gabrielle Oettingen argues that too much positive visualisation can rob a person of their desire to succeed – they get happy enough just dreaming about something and never end up doing it. Any goal you set will usually have obstacles in the way of you achieving them (if they were easy everyone would be able to achieve them!). It’s tempting to think that your obstacles will mainly come from outside of you: changing jobs markets, your parents splitting up, friendships ending, etc. These things happen, of course, but most of the obstacles you will face will come from within yourself. The phrase ‘self-sabotage’ is often used to describe how we end up becoming the obstacle to our own aims because of the ways in which we think or behave. Check out the video to understsand more about the technique owe use in this activity to reframe your thinking:",
