      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nIn his 1998 book, How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable About Anything, American psychologist Albert Ellis looked at irrational and negative thinking experienced by people in times of stress. He particularly looked at types of thoughts that people experience when things go badly. He called this ‘crooked thinking’.\nHis work can be directly applied to students in stressful situations – see if you’ve experienced these kinds of thoughts when things go wrong:\n\n\tNot fair thinking: -  ‘I don’t deserve this treatment. Things shouldn’t be like this.’\n\tCatastrophe thinking - : ‘If this goes wrong, it’ll be a total nightmare.’\n\tStopper thinking - : ‘I’m useless. I can’t do this. I’m bound to screw up.’\n\tIllogical thinking: -  ‘If this bad thing happens, this one will surely follow.’\n\tBlaming Thinking -  ‘It’s his fault. It’s everyone’s fault except me.’\n\tOvergeneralising: -  ‘I never get the breaks. This always happens to me. Everything is going wrong in my life.’\nAlison Ledgerwood, University of California professor of Psychology, studies how people tend to get stuck in particular ways of thinking and what they can do to get unstuck. In her video below she explains how the brain is wired for negative thoughts, and suggests how to change it.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsLike anything worthwhile, reframing thoughts takes effort. But you’ll be surprised how quickly you can turn yourself into someone much more positive and optimistic.\nYour friends and peers are an important contributing factor to your mood. Have a look at The Vampire Test Activity to help establish which of your friends are helping you and those that aren't.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nSprinter Usain Bolt’s celebratory position – arms outstretched above his head as soon as he crosses the 100m finish line – is typical of the confident and victorious poses adopted by sportspeople and winners.\nAmy Cuddy, a social psychologist at Harvard University, has looked at why people adopt this pose and the effects it can have on your physiology.\nShe has found that by changing your physiology (or your posture) you can have a profound effect on how you feel. In her 2012 TED talk, ‘Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are’, she argues that by standing in certain ‘power poses’ you can increase your confidence and self-esteem, enhance your memory and reduce feelings of fear. Cuddy goes on to argue that weaker postures (such as curling up, making yourself small or moving into defensive positions) trigger other psychological responses – feelings of imminent danger, stress or threat.\nAnd yet we often see nervous students hunched over their notes or hiding in a corner in those last few moments before an exam!\nInstead, we think it’s worth trying more confident and powerful postures before taking your final exams or important assessments.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsMany professionals talk about the importance of energy, movement, exercise and positivity to break up a challenging working day. Take some time to schedule in a walk, a run, a session at the gym or a power pose.\nIs there a particular time of the week you could do this?",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nAmerican journalist Dan Coyle (author of The Talent Code and The Little Book of Talent) argues that mistakes are information. He says that those who have become brilliant at something have got better at it quickly because they have made a lot of mistakes and they have paid attention to their mistakes and drawn the learning out from them.\nSo, failure is important if we are ultimately going to succeed. There are, however, different attitudes to failure. Some students hate it and avoid it at all costs. It makes them feel embarrassed, humiliated, worthless. They hide mistakes, don’t complete tests or skip hard homework so they can avoid failing. As a result they make slower progress.\nOther students recognise the importance of failure. Your job is to try to become one of these people.\nJohn Maxwell puts it this way in his book Failing Forward (2012): \"Some people fail backwards.The failure takes them in a backwards direction, whereas some people fail forwards (the failure accelerates their progress).\"\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsLook at Maxwell’s descriptions of ‘failing backwards’.\nWhich of these are most like you? If you could pick one that you feel you need to stop doing which would it be? What are you going to do instead? Using Maxwell’s suggestions as a starting point, list possible actions you could take.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nOur response to getting feedback can vary considerably. Some people are hungry for feedback and want\nto know how they can improve; others avoid feedback like the plague and take it personally. If you want to\nget good grades at GCSE you are going to have to get comfortable with feedback.\nSteve Bull, in his brilliant\nbook \n\tThe Game Plan (2006), has developed an acronym, SADRAA, to help you with the process. He\nsuggests that when you get feedback you might not be happy with, you should work through three stages:\nthe red zone, the blue zone and the green zone.\nThe image below explains the zones.\n\n Low performing pupils can sometimes get caught up in the red zone and\nsome might never leave. You might know people like this!  It’s fine to have these initial emotions, of course, but\nthen you must push through the next two stages.\nThe next time that you have some feedback that you might not be happy with, use this activity to record your own thoughts or check in with your emotional response to the criticism and see which zone you’re\nin. Then look ahead to the next zone and see what kind of thoughts you might try to have to move yourself\nthrough the process more quickly.\nUltimately, you’ll be much happier if you avoid getting stuck in the red or\nblue zone!\nIt might be tricky to get to the green zone, so feel free to leave it a day or so – maybe longer – before\ncompleting the final section or considering the ideas you see there.\nBelow is an example of some feedback given to a sociology student:\nThe feedback is quite detailed and could easily be viewed as critical, particularly if the student had put in a lot of effort into their work.  The table below shows how the SADRAA process might work with this feedback, and how important it is to get through to the final stages.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nOne way to fully understand Bull’s model is to watch other people responding to feedback. Watch for\nfeedback after a sporting fxture, and see how players react. Watch out for how your parents describe taking\nfeedback, or even your teachers. Most of all, watch for how your friends talk about feedback. If you’re\nsurrounded by people who can’t take feedback, it makes it harder to learn how to handle it well. Austin Kleon (2014), a writer and artist, warns us to; \"..make sure we have positive friends.\" He calls negative friends\n‘vampires’. Kleon advises that, “if, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is\na vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire.” It’s worth thinking about the five people you spend most time with, and asking yourself fve questions\nabout them:Are they positive people?Do they enjoy their lives?Are they a good infuence?Have they helped you through problems?Do they make you feel good about yourself, and about life?",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nTwo psychologists, Robert Emmons and Michael McCullough (2003) at the University of Miami, asked thisquestion:\n\t\"what if we reviewed stressful and difficult times and turned our attention to the lessons we learned from those negative experiences?\".   \n\tThree hundred pupils were asked to refect on challenging periods of their lives: poor results, breaking up\nwith partners, feeling insulted or ofended, or being rejected from a particular course. Of the 300 subjects,\n100 were asked to specifically focus on the lessons they had learned – the positive benefts that had\neventually come from these challenges. It turned out that it was these pupils who coped better with their\ndisasters and moved on from them. Emmons and McCullough found that positive benefts could flow from\nnegative experiences.\n\n\n\tDavid Collins, professor of coaching and performance at the University of Central Lancashire, has coached\nat the very top level, including being responsible for UK athletics at the Beijing Olympic Games. Collins, with\nhis colleague Áine MacNamara, has done similar work to Emmons and McCullough. He’s discovered that\ntop athletes have travelled what he calls a ‘rocky road’. This means that they’ve usually had their fair share of\nsetbacks, failures and disappointments along the way. Often, we don’t get to hear about these setbacks – we only hear about the successes!\nProfessor Collins suggests that the rocky road might even be good for you as you will develop some useful skills along the way. The key thing is not to dwell on the setback and to bounce back.\nThe iceburg illusion is another common way to demonstrate the level of effort required \"below the surface\"  for success, which are not apparent on the \"surface\". This activity is about finding the benefits in amongst the sacrifice and disappointments that can occur in your journey to success.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nWe’ve found it really useful to normalise setbacks and problems by asking others about theirs. We’ve done it\nloads. It’s such a relief to hear other people sharing their catastrophes!\nYou might ask a parent, an aunt or uncle, a friend or an older cousin. Teachers are often willing to tell you their\nstories too. A good prompt to start the conversation might be, “Tell me the story of your biggest study disaster!”\nFinish with, “What did you learn from it?”",

We have included 3 different activities to help reduce your stress.\n\nBreath 1: Breathe in through the nose until the lungs are full and the chest is expanded. Take four seconds to fll your lungs. If you want a word in your head to help clear thoughts, the word can be ‘right’ as you imagine a pen travelling rightwards as it draws the bottom line of the box. Once you’re full, hold the breath for four seconds.\n\nBreath 2: Breathe out through the slightly open mouth. Take four seconds to totally empty your lungs. The word ‘up’ can be mentally repeated here if you need, as you imagine a line being drawn up to make the right-hand side of the box. When you’re totally empty, hold for four seconds.\n\nBreath 3: Breathe in through the nose until the lungs are full and the chest is expanded. Take four seconds to fll your lungs. If you want a word in your head to help clear thoughts, the word can be ‘left’ as you imagine a pen travelling leftwards across the top line of the box. Once you’re full, hold the breath for four seconds.\n\nBreath 4: Breathe out through the slightly open mouth. Take four seconds to totally empty your lungs. The word ‘down’ can be mentally repeated here if you need, as you imagine a line being drawn down to complete the box. When you’re totally empty, hold for four seconds. You’re done!\n\n\n2 - DELIBERATE KINDNESS\n\nSuggested by a leader at Google, this deliberate kindness exercise takes very little time, but when repeated\nit has hugely positive efects.\n\nBecause stress or anxiety is a focus on the self, activities like this work because\nthey require you to place your focus on others.\n\nVersion 1:\n\n\n\tChoose three people – parents, friends, peers, tutors or teachers, brothers, sisters or cousins.\n\tGive each of them ten seconds of your time, bringing them to mind, one at a time, as vividly as you can.\nMentally say: ‘I wish for this person to be happy.’ Imagine them happy. Repeat the phrase mentally if you\nneed to for ten seconds.\n\t\n\tRepeat for your three people. That’s it. \n\nVersion 2:\n\n(Try this in a public place – a study room, library, cafe, bus station, watching a crowd through a window somewhere.)\n\n\n\tCast your eyes over the crowds around you and choose three random people.\n\tGive each of them ten seconds of your time, one at a time, as vividly as you can. Mentally say: ‘I wish for\nthis person to be happy.’ Imagine them happy. Repeat the phrase mentally if you need to for ten seconds.\n\t\n\tDo it for three people. You’re done.\nWhen repeated, this exercise trains your brain to spend just a little time focusing on others. \n\t\nWriter, teacher and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss says the following in his book Tools of Titans(2017, p. 159):\n\n\n‘I tend to do a single 3- to 5-minute session at night, thinking of three people I want to be happy, often two current friends and one old friend I haven’t seen in years. A mere three days into doing this … I found myself wondering throughout the day “Why am I so happy?” … you easily get caught in the whirlpool of thinking about your “stuff\" This loving-kindness drill takes the focus of you entirely – which, for me, immediately resolves at least 90% of the mental chatter.’\n\n\n3 - CONCERN vs CONTROL\n\nThis activity, adapted from Stephen Covey’s excellent book 'The 7 Habits of Highly Efective People (1989)',\nasks you spend five minutes or so listing the things that are taking up your mental space and energy. Here’s\nwhat you do:\n\n\n\tListen to your anxieties and worries (your ‘mental chatter’ as Tim Ferriss calls it) and write it all down – for\nexample, ‘worrying about the news’, ‘worrying about what questions might appear on my next exam’,\n‘stressing about what people might think of my recent post on social media’, ‘thinking about ice cream’.\n\t\n\tPut them in all in one big circle, so they look like they’re all jostling around in your head. Now draw a\nsecond circle, of to the right or left, away from your head.\n\t\n\tNext, review every item in the circle that looks like your head, crowded with crazy thoughts and issues,\none at a time. For each item, ask yourself, ‘What control do I have over this?’\n\t\n\tIf there’s something you can do to control the outcome of the worry, it stays in the frst circle (your head).\nLabel this circle ‘control’. If there’s little or nothing you can do to control the outcome of the thought or\nworry, it leaves your head and goes to the second circle. This is going to be called ‘concern’ – the things\nyou think about but have little or no infuence over. \n\t\nPeople who handle stress well minimise the stuff in the ‘concern’ circle. They practise forgetting about it. They\nspend their energy on the things in the ‘control’ circle and make plans. Finish the exercise by deciding one simple thing you could do to improve each of the issues/situations in your circle of control.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nFeeling anxious or stressed about study is often a matter of perspective – about shifting your focus away from\nthe self towards something else. That’s why anything that makes you feel small or insignifcant helps clear your\nhead. If you’re interested, here’s two ways to do it:\nThe outdoors:We’ve spoken to pupils who have walked to the top of a hill near their house. From the top, the hugeness of\nthe world makes them feel tiny. And that helps make them feel better. (“My problems seem stupid and small,”\none pupil told us.) Another, looking out across the whole city, realised that there were others with much bigger\ntroubles than they had.\nThe night sky\nullother way to help realise the smallness of your life on this planet is to gaze at the star-flled sky. Again, all of\na sudden, an issue with a GCSE test seems tiny in comparison to the vastness of the universe. And that can\nhelp you re-gain perspective.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nDr Steve Bull was the England Cricket Team’s psychologist for seventeen years, working with players who\nexperienced huge pressure to perform day in, day out. As a result, he has developed a series of interesting\ntools for boosting people’s confdence in their own ability. In his book, \n\tThe Game Plan (2006), Bull says,\n\t‘It seems to be a human frailty that we are programmed to focus on failure and disappointment far more than\non success and accomplishment. We find it very easy to recall those disastrous days when everything went\nwrong.’\n\t He goes on to say that ‘When we are faced with a similar challenge, our brains are quick to recall the\nprevious catastrophe.’ \n\tHe then concludes that ‘the cycle must be broken, and the most efective way of doing\nthis is to actively reconnect your mind with previous accomplishments’.\n\t Dr Bull worked with cricketers asking\nthem to record their previous successes, and saw their confdence rocket and their performances improve as\na result.\nBull uses mountain peaks as his confidence metaphor, but we prefer the image of a phone battery. We like\nthe idea of a battery because confidence in your ability gives you energy. It charges you up and flls you with\nstrength and belief. You can keep your battery topped up by recalling those times when things went brilliantly\nulld you really achieved what you were capable of.\n\nThis activity asks you to imagine you have five energy slots to fill in your battery, above. You should fill each slot with a brief description of a time when you\nperformed really well and achieved something you are pleased with or proud of. When you’re feeling low, you\ncan return to your battery, read the information there and feel yourself recharge with positivity and purpose.\n\nREFLECT🤔If you’re feeling low, a natural response to a task like this might be – “I can’t think of anything.” We’ve worked\nwith lots of pupils who’ve responded this way. We’ve also responded this way ourselves when we’ve felt down\nabout our situation or circumstances.\nHere’s some advice for when your inner critic – that negative voice we all sometimes have inside us – gets too\nnoisy and confdent:\nKill all comparisons. Let your negative voice say what it wants for a few minutes, but all comparisons are\nbanned. If it tries telling you, “You’re not as good as…” – shut it down. It’s called ‘impostor syndrome’, where\nyou feel you are a fraud. “I don’t deserve to be here” or “Others are cleverer than me” are common feelings\nulld messages. Refuse to accept the voice if it tries any comparisons like these. Use the space below to design a response to your inner critic when it gets like this.

Each of us has a signifcant\nnetwork of support around us, but it’s a natural tendency sometimes to think, ‘If I ask for help it must mean\nI’m failing. I need to do this alone.’ But seeking help just makes everything easier. So don’t believe the story that goes, ‘One day I’ll have to stand\non my own two feet. I may as well start now.’ As you grow up and face new challenges, there will always be\npeople around you who can help; someone who’s done it before and can give you some advice. Nowadays,\nthat help is just a search engine away – you can contact experts in thousands of felds through social media.\nYou could spend a very successful life continually asking for help! But still the myth persists that we must do it alone. This activity should support you in auditing (that means\nlisting and organising) every single person who could be on your team. And from there, you can decide who\nyou need to help you with some upcoming challenges. The image above depicts your network of influence. You’re the dot at the top and underneath you is a team of\npeople all waiting for the chance to support you. First, make\na list of everyone you can think of that fits into the\ncategories above. Think of friends you have at school, but also\nthose you might have outside of school,\non social media or at other schools.Who among your peers has the\npotential to help you out? Who, a\nfew years older, has gone through\nthis already? Who’s an expert\non the subjects you’re\nstruggling with? Which of\nyour friends has an older brother or sister you could speak to?Think about your parents, of course, but also aunties, uncles, cousins and family friends.You attend a school where every paid member of staff has a genuine interest in helping you improve. Your\nfirst thoughts might be your own teachers, but what about other staff members – librarians, tutors and\nmentors? All of them will have something to offer.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nSome very successful people become successful precisely because they asked for help from so many people.\nThe entrepreneur and writer Tim Ferriss’s most recent book is 2017’s Tribe of Mentors. Ferriss fnds himself at\n40 years old, a successful author and investor, wanting help and support with so many queries and questions\nthat he decides to ask for advice from a hundred people. He emails them all and asks them what they might\ndo in his shoes. The result is a book full of amazing and inspiring advice and guidance.\nSo don’t lose the opportunity to ask for help!",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nThis activity is based on the work of David Kolb of the University of Leicester. Kolb’s work suggests that\nwe learn best through experience – through doing. If we take action and attempt a challenge (therefore\nexperiencing something rather than just reading or thinking about it) our awareness, understanding and\nmastery increases. Kolb proposes that ‘experiential learning’, as he calls it, passes through four phases.\nWhen we frst saw Kolb’s work, his four phases were presented as a framework for problem solving. It worked\nreally well for us and we became hooked. We’ll share what we learned with you here. You’ll need to set aside\nthirty minutes to start with.\nFirst, choose a problem you’re battling with or a barrier you’re facing. It might be to do with study habits,\ncurrent performance, levels of energy or a subject-specifc issue.\nNext break down the problem into the four stages of Kolb’s problem solving cycle. Use the guidance below to\ninform you how to approach each stage\nFirst an example problem:\n\"I use to be really good at maths but have got worse since starting my GCSE's. My last assessment was a grade 4, a drop of 2 grades! I seem to be getting worse just when I need to be getting better!! The final exam is in 3 months and I feel really worried about it\"\nThe following images show how we can use Kolbs learning cycle to try and solve this common problem.\nStage 1 - Explore the problem using \"concrete experience\"\n\nStage 2 - Analyse the problem - consider why it is happening?\n\nStage 3 - Decide on a course of action, consider all your options (this is called abstract conceptualisation) \n\nStage 4 - Finally experiment with an action, review after a week to consider how successful the action was.\nEach of us apparently has a preference for one of these stages and might have a tendency to linger in it or\neven stay there as long as possible. We all know someone who endlessly talks about a problem without ever\ndoing something about it. That person might feel most comfortable in stage 2 – analysing the problem. Other\npeople you know might leap to a swift conclusion and do something straight away without properly thinking it\nthrough – perhaps they feel less comfortable in stages 1 and 2 and want to hurry on to stages 3 and 4.Use the following activity to work through a problem you are currently facing.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nKolb’s approach to problem solving is called ‘Root-Cause Analysis’ – that is, a close examination of why a\nproblem is occurring – what’s at its root; or where it’s growing from.\nBut there are other approaches to problem solving. Have a look at this short list, and see if alternative\napproaches might help you generate possible solutions too. There’s a little space under each approach for\nyou to scribble some initial ideas – maybe one of these will unlock your issue!",

Her research has\nfocused on helping pupils to improve their memory, which is pretty useful for GCSE pupils. She shared this\nactivity with us – many thanks, Jennifer. Over to you! Taking a test does more than just assess your abilities; research has shown that it can also improve your\nmemory for the information tested. Henry Roediger at Washington University has led the research in this area,\nnow known as the ‘testing effect’. The term ‘test’ in this context refers to the act of retrieving information from your long-term memory. This can\ntake many forms such as reciting facts about the Second World War aloud or completing a practice essay\nquestion. The test format is irrelevant; as long as you recall the information from memory, the rate at which you\nforget this information in the future is slowed down. This is in stark contrast to repeated study (reading over\nnotes/highlighting text); when this technique is used information is forgotten much more quickly afterwards. Despite huge amounts of research all showing the clear benefits of testing, most pupils prefer to revise for\nexams by reading information repeatedly. This is because the more you read something, the more familiar the\ncontent feels, resulting in a false sense of understanding and accomplishment. In contrast, testing yourself\ncan feel challenging and frustrating, especially when you start to revise a new topic and it feels like you are\nnot recalling very much at all. Don’t let this put you off: searching for the right answer (even unsuccessfully)\nstrengthens the pathways in your brain for that information. Although it may feel counterintuitive to test\nyourself, struggling is good for your brain and results in excellent learning in the end! Remember that all exams require you to recall information; it is unlikely that an exam will test you on how well\nyou can read text over and over again. Every time you test yourself you are reinforcing the connections in your\nbrain in an outward direction, making them increasingly accessible for when you need it most – in an exam! Top tips for testing yourself: Create elaborate links between new information and existing knowledge -  This will make it easier to cue\nyourself during tests.Mind-maps are a great way of testing yourself -  Close your books and scribble down everything you can\nremember. Number the points to track your progress.Feedback is essential when testing yourself -  This prevents you learning any mistakes you may have\nmade. This is especially important if you are using multiple choice tests as the right and wrong answers can\nbe very similar.Follow our activity to build yourself a killer test.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nSometimes we have a tendency to return to topics we know well. It makes us feel comfortable and\nconfident to keep reviewing material we’re confident about. But really you should be prioritising topics which\nyou find trickier.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nCal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. He’s written a\nfew great books to help pupils achieve the best grades they can. It’s worth taking a look at his website:\n\t\n\twww.calnewport.com.\nIn addition to teaching pupils at university, he’s been fascinated by the strategies pupils use to help them get\ngreat grades. He suggests that when it comes to revision there are two types: active recall and passive recall.\n\n\tActive recall -  actively trying to understand and synthesise the information by teaching it.\n(Don’t worry – you don’t need your own class of year 7s for this! You can do it alone, or to someone else; a\nfriend, a parent or a sibling.)\n\t\n\tPassive recall - by contrast, is just sitting passively reading your notes.\nNewport makes a bold statement: active recall is the only revision strategy that counts! He argues that there are three huge benefits to this type of super-charged revision:\n\t\n\t\tIt’s very effective.\n\t\tIt saves time. \n\t\tIt’s difficult and mentally uncomfortable. (Don’t worry, it’s supposed to be!) \n\t\nSo how to do you do it?\nWe’ve set a little challenge for you. We want you to only use active recall for the next test you have in one of\nyour subjects. During this time you are not allowed to use any other strategy. You are either doing active recall\nor preparing for it. No sitting comfortably and reading your notes!\nIf you’re interested in trying this experiment, you’ll need to start about three weeks before a test or mock exam\nulld you’ll need to set aside a few hours each week. Block the time out on your planner before you start, then\nfollow our CASTT process.\nWeek 1: Collect and Arrange (C and A) \nThis week is preparation week – we call it ‘collect and arrange’ because it gives you chance to gather\neverything you need and make sense of it. The first thing you need to do is identify and collect the topics that\nyou will be tested on; make a list of them. A syllabus might help here, or a list provided by a teacher. Once\nyou’ve got your list of topics, you’re really in business. You know the size of the job ahead of you.\nOnce you’ve identified and collected together your topics you need to arrange or organise your notes for the\ntopics, and try and condense the material into a small space – one or two sides of A4, for example. It might\nbe useful to use mind-maps for this, or other graphic organisers like tables, lists, bullet-points or flow charts.\nWeeks 2 and 3: Search (S) and Teach (T) \nNow you’ll need to do a search for any past paper questions connected to the topics you’ve collected and\narranged in week 1. You’re trying to find example tests that are as close to the one you’re going to experience\nin the test coming up – in other words, to reproduce the test experience! Search everywhere. Do you already\nhave exam questions in your books or folders? Did your teachers hand some out? Are there some on your\nschool’s online resources or in the school library? Maybe an exam-board website can help. You want to be the\nperson who has searched out more exam questions than anyone else!\nOnce you’ve got your hoard, you can begin teaching – in other words, it’s active recall only! Grab your\nexam question, write it in the middle of a piece of A4 and plan an answer around it. Now: imagine you’re a\nteacher, explaining how to answer the question to your class. Imagine this class really need things explaining\nslowly and clearly, and you’re at the front with a whiteboard, explaining exactly what to do, how to do it and\nwhy to do it.\nIn week 2 it might be that you try to teach the information with only yourself present. Have the mind-map in\nfront of you and aim to recall and explain as much information as possible without looking. It might be useful\nto cover up your mind-map and then just expose sections if you are struggling. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect –\nit won’t be at first. Remember that you have to speak out loud. It will feel odd at first but just keep going.\nIn week 3 you might try teaching with an audience. Give someone the mind-map while you try to recall. Get\nthe observer to make a note of anything you miss. Then try it again.\nFinally: Test (T) \nFinally, to check that the process is working effectively you must test yourself. Put away all the midmaps and\nnotes from week one, two and three, clear your desk and put your phone on airplane settings. Now, write a\nresponse to the exam question under timed conditions. Take it to a teacher for marking, or check it against a mark scheme. And that’s it! Active recall in four steps. It might not always feel easy or relaxed, but it’s quick, intense, and\neffective. Remember CASTT next time you need to practice for a test or exam!\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nWhenever you trail a different method of revising it’s worth testing how effective it is! If you’re not convinced,\ndo one day of revising using your usual techniques and then test yourself at the end of the day and then do\none day using C.A.S.T.T. and test yourself at the end as well.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nFor some pupils the only work they ever do has been set by their teacher:\nDo you ever do more?\nWe’ve found that the top performing pupils are usually setting their own work if their teacher hasn’t set it for\nthem. This can be hard, though, particularly if you aren’t sure exactly what work to set yourself.\nTeachers quite\noften say to pupils that they should be doing \n\t‘independent learning’ or ‘reading around the subject’.  But what\ndoes that actually mean?\nWe would suggest that you get much more specific and design your independent learning so that you know\nexactly what you should be doing and how long it should take you. Your teacher will also have some ideas about specific independent learning you could be doing so don't forget to ask.\nFive Independent Learning ActivitiesFor each of your GCSE subjects we suggest that you design five activities.\nUse the following stages to create each activity\n\n\tFirst, identify the topic -  What is it you’d like to spend some more time on?\n\tSecond, decide what are you going to do - e.g. Watch a YouTube video, read a book or do some online research?\n\tThird, find where you need to go to get access to the resources -  e.g. the specific link to the Youtube clip, or chapter of a textbook\n\tFinally, decide which activity are you going to do? - Remember, doing some active work is going to be more beneficial than passive activities, e.g. Making a mind-map, or create some flashcards.\n\t\tWe have created a list below, with our top 15 independent learning activities to choose from:Creating flashcards as a memory aid.Making a clear, visual overview of a course, connecting all the content in a huge diagram/mind-map.Reading lots of exam questions and seeing if you can recognise ‘types’ or ‘genres’ of question.Asking for extra work to be assessed and carefully reading the feedback you get.Creating a glossary of key words with definitions.Expanding class notes with reference to textbooks.Representing complicated information visually using a table, chart or diagram.Reading through an examiners’ report and making a list of dos and don’ts.Choosing a specific area of difficulty and discussing it in detail with a friend.Planning responses to past exam questions.Borrowing someone else’s class notes and using them to expand yours.Finding a brilliant course textbook and reading a chapter, making notes as you go.Watching online videos and interacting with associated VLE resources.Arranging a meeting with an older student or sibling who has done the course before.Writing for twenty minutes under timed conditions.Try the following activity to start developing your independent learning\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nThis activity works well with the weekly planner.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nThe places we choose to work in often have a big impact on how effective our work is. Our environments can\ninfluence the quality of our concentration and focus in both positive and negative ways. An interesting study by\ntwo researchers at Reading University, \n\tDerek Clements-Croome and Li Baizhan (2000), found that UK office\nworkers felt significantly less productive as their work environment became more crowded or cramped, as\ntemperatures varied or the quality of light diminished. A large majority of the subjects interviewed estimated\nthey might get a 10% rise in productivity if their environment was better.\nWe’ve seen similar effects with thousands of pupils over twenty years of teaching. And, surprisingly, we’ve\nseen pupils who deliberately sit down to work in noisy, distracting locations so they can be disturbed.\nWhen we meet to talk about their lack of progress, they’ll often tell us, ‘Well, I tried to work, but I couldn’t\nconcentrate,’ or ‘I like working with lots of people around me.’ Inevitably, when we check the quality of their\nwork, they’ve expended lots of time but in fact got very little done.\nWhat are your work environments like, and what link might they have to your levels of focus, concentration\nulld flow?\nBy figuring out where you work best, you can increase your levels of concentration – and get more\nquality work done in less time.\nChanging Spaces\nBenedict Carey, in his book How We Learn, discusses some fascinating research about environment\nulld memory. Research shows that changing the space in which you study increases your chances of\nremembering the material you’ve studied. Something about the freshness and variation in space makes\nthe material more easily accessible in your memory. Swap high flow study spaces often and you may well\nremember more of what you’ve studied.\nSo, the more high flow study spaces you have at your disposal, the better you’ll do!\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nA new, unfamiliar space often reminds us we’re trying to work differently. Even a small change to your room at\nhome works like a quick visual reminder that you’re planning on practising harder!\nThink about moving the position of your desk, pinning up some quotes, a timetable or some notes and\nreminders, moving your bed or your chest of drawers. All these small things will help reinforce the change\nyou’re making in the way you work.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nBefore you really begin to attack your revision, you need to be able to actively recast the information you\nneed to learn. That means rewriting or reorganising your class notes into something you have built yourself\n– something you’ve processed and created. No passive reading and highlighting of notes here – just active,\nengaged rewriting!\nYou don’t want to be spending too much of your time on this – we recommend about 50% of your revision\ntime\n\t should be recasting notes – but it’s a crucial step.\nOne way to do it that we’ve really enjoyed is the nine-box grid. (An A level physics pupil taught us this one. He\nended up at Oxford so we know it works!) And here’s the best bit: all you’ll need is a sheet of A4 paper.\nThere are three steps to filling in the grid:\n\n\t\n\tYour challenge is to summarise an entire topic (or, if you’re feeling brave, an entire course) in nine boxes.\nFirst, you need to read through your notes on the topic/course and decide what your nine boxes are. Ask\nyourself: \n\twhat are the nine key subsections? Ask teachers to suggest nine. Work with friends to identify\nthe nine. Go through exam papers to see if they help you decide on the nine. Once you’ve got the nine subsections, you need to find a way to summarise your notes using just the little boxes on the grid. You can’t use any additional space. Also, don’t try to write so small you can’t read it! Use diagrams, pictures, mind-maps or other graphic organisers to condense your information. It is useful to do this using a PC so you can reduce the size of text and add images.Do what you have to, but get it all down in the nine little boxes. Then photograph or save it in case it gets lost!  Below is an example from a GCSE Chemistry Syllabus (AQA) - \n\tTopic 1 - Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table:\n\tIn this example our student looked at the syllabus and found there were 13 topics. Part of the process involved combining some topics together, which can also help your understanding.\n\tNow read through the whole grid and, on the other side, draw up a list of key concepts, ideas and\nvocabulary you’re going to need to master. That’s it. An entire course or topic on one sheet of paper.\nOnce you’ve got your nine-box grid, you’re ready to attempt exam questions. You’ll see other pupils\nlaboriously rereading their notes or copying out the entire course in their lucky pen – but ignore them. You’ve\ngot the content nailed on one sheet!\n\tUse our activity on the following page to start your own Nine Box Grid.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nRemember, even if you’re the greatest builder of nine-box grids the world has ever seen, you still need to\nbe moving on to other revision activities – the ones that will test your skills and get you used to performing\nconfdently under exam conditions.\nWe’d recommend you do two things next:\nCheck your responses to the revision questionnaire, and move onto activities in the S and F sections of the\nquestionnaire now that you’ve mastered C – the content bit.\nTry using your nine-box grid as the basis of another activity in this book; It’s Time to Teach, aka C.A.S.T.T. If\nyou’ve got a nine-box grid done, you’ve already completed the C. and A. of our C.A.S.T.T. activity!",

It’s quite normal when you think about it. We all like to spend time on activities we\nfeel comfortable or confident doing. The problem can be that we’re putting off things we feel uncomfortable with or don’t like doing. Everyone has heard of Usain Bolt – the world’s fastest man to ever run 100 metres. He has an interesting way\nof approaching his training. He works out where his weak spots are and then spends most of his time training\non them. For Bolt, that’s the start of his 100 metres. He’s a big guy and getting out of the blocks requires a lot\nof effort for him. He says he knows that it’s his area of vulnerability. He’s not great at it (he’s ‘low skill’ when it\ncomes to bursting from the blocks), and what’s more, he doesn’t particularly enjoy this aspect of his training\n(he is ‘low will’ in this area – that is, he has to force himself to do it, almost against his will). Despite these\nobstacles, Bolt spends a significant part of his training on this element because he knows that this is where he\ncan improve the most. The will vs. skill matrix is a useful way of helping you to identify where you need to spend your time practising.\nIt’s not just Bolt’s idea; it was made popular in the Tao of Coaching by Max Landsberg. Let’s see if it helps you\nlike it helped Usain Bolt.\n\nREFLECT🤔",

In other words, rather than cram immediately\nbefore an exam, you can save time and energy by starting earlier and spacing out smaller sessions of practice\nulld revision. You use your memory more this way. And as Benedict Carey says in his book \n\tHow We Learn (2015, p. 40), ‘using memory changes memory’. The more often something is recalled, the stronger the\nmemory gets; a cycle of : ‘\n\tlearn, forget, relearn, remember again’ is strengthening your memory. A whole bunch\nof studies show that this process of spaced practice works way better than cramming. It also involves working\nfor shorter periods rather than sitting down for epic sessions the night before an exam. That’s a win-win.\nBut how do you space out practice? \nWell, that depends on how long it is before your exam In this activity we aim to build a programme of spaced practice\nthat assumes three months until your exam, however if you’re using this at another time of year, which is closer or further away to your exams, don’t worry!\nA study by academic researchers at the University of California San Diego \n\t(Capeda et al., 2008) concluded the\nfollowing about spacing:\n\nSo, for our purposes, you need to be reviewing topics every two weeks, allowing them to fade in the gaps,\nthen refreshing them when the next test comes along.\nYou don’t necessarily have to do this for all your exams. Start by choosing a subject that you think needs\na boost and plan out some spaced practice using a grid like the one shown below. For each subject select 3 different types of practice, spread over the 12 week period:\n\n\tRevise - An intial study of the topic, summarising and going over the information\n\tDeep Review - An in depth revision session, re-remembering everything\n\tQuick Review - A shorter, light touch review, just to check your memory\n\nThe images below take you through the process with an example of how your schedule might look for 5 different subjects or topic areas.\n\nREFLECT 🤔",

This means that probably you will be unlikely to sit down and finish the whole activity or project in one go. Gone are the Key Stage 3 days when most homework could be completed within ffteen or twenty minutes!\nSooner or later you’re going to get a piece of homework or coursework that you know is going to take a few hours to complete. At first this can be quite daunting. Often, when we are faced with a large piece of work like this we procrastinate (put it of) because we’re not sure where to start.\nThere’s an old Chinese proverb that says, ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.’ Chunking will help you to take that frst step.\nHere’s how it works. Let’s imagine that you’ve decided to run a marathon in a year’s time. There are a number of things you might need to do (run a lot of miles is the obvious one!), but you can’t go straight out and run twenty-six miles. You frst need to frst break down all the tasks you might need to do:\n\n\tBuy some trainers\n\tJoin a running club\n\tFind a coach\n\tRun a 10K\n\tEnter a race\nThis would be the start of the list – there’s much more than we’ve listed here. The second step is to set yourself some milestones (what you need to have done and by when).\nYou can use the same process with a long and challenging piece of work. The following activity takes you through the steps you might need to take:\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nOnce you have finished this activity, print it out and pin it up somewhere clear and prominent, and remember to check it regularly!When pupils use the chunking activity, one challenge they face to sticking to the steps at each stage. If you don’t do the activities on the frst step, it’s unlikely that you’ll meet the deadline.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nEveryone’s day moves through phases, and you’re probably no diferent – there are times when you’re fired up and raring to go, there are times when your energy levels are just average and there are times when you feel your attention is low and your motivation dips.These three phases happen to everyone during a working day. You’re not unusual if you have low energy levels or can’t concentrate; if you catch yourself looking around you and seeing others hard at work, remember they’re no diferent to you – just in a diferent phase of their day.Some people can predict when they’re going to be feeling fred up (it might be the mornings, it might be after breakfast or after exercise) and when they’re going to feel slower. Others haven’t noticed a pattern, but once they pay attention they see one emerging. For others, it’s totally random.\nGraham Allcott, founder of Think Productive (http://thinkproductive.co.uk), and author of \"how to be productivity ninja\", uses the following defnitions for the three states:\n\n\tProactive attention (fully focused, fred up, feeling fresh).\n\tActive attention (plugged in, ticking along nicely).\n\tInactive attention (fagging, fried, foggy).\nHe argues that really successful people get work done in all three states. They don’t give up when they’re in state 3, they just switch tasks. Make a list of all the tasks you’ve got on your plate at the moment. Think of everything – homework, reading, essays, revision, upcoming tests, college interviews, etc.\nNext you categorise them. Complex and challenging tasks go in ‘proactive attention’. When you feel fully focused, fred up and fresh, you tackle those. Regular tasks go in ‘active attention’. They’re tasks to get on with when you feel you’re ticking along nicely. Repetitive tasks that are pretty easy go in ‘inactive attention’. When you’re feeling fried or foggy, you switch to those tasks.Try the following activity with your current to do list.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nOne way to log your attention is by colour coding. Use green for proactive attention, amber for active attention, and red for inactive. You could use a grid that looks something like this\n\nWe’ve found that certain people move through predictable phases of attention. Some start the day full of energy,but dip slowly as the day goes on. Others respond to food (!), feeling more sluggish after lunch. Below is an example of a grid created by a student.\n\nFrom this we can see that the most productive hours are in the morning and evenings.\nSome students have worked out ways to jump into proactive attention before doing an important piece of work.This last skill is really valuable. If you can boost your attention, you can get more work done in less time. Tryexperimenting with boosting attention. We’ve spoken to students who do the following to boost their attention:\n\tExercise just before studying: A run, a walk, a quick jog around the block, even an intense burst of star jumps! \n\tMusic just before studying: A loud burst of motivating music with headphones on. \n\tOther pre-work rituals: Some students talk about tidying their work spaces to get ‘in the zone’, or having\na hot shower, or getting changed or a quick ten-minute burst of game-playing (bright, colourful puzzlers work\nway better than long, complex strategy or RPGs).",

The trouble with listing jobs is that a list doesn’t allow you to see the bigger picture; you can’t assess the progress of whole projects, you can only pick of small individual tasks.\nUsing a matrix or a grid helps you to assess the status of entire subjects. And once you’ve got a good sense of how an entire subject is going, you can use your time much more efectively, targeting your energy where it's most needed.\nThe image below shows an example of a matrix which we have used successfully with hundreds of students. We ask them to first plot each of their subjects, or unit topics, onto this grid:\n\n\nOnce you’ve made these decisions and placed these projects as dots or crosses on the grid, make notes under each dot explaining the reasons why you’ve positioned it there.\nBelow is an example of how one of our a GCSE students plotted their subjects.\n\nREFLECT🤔\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHere’s the problem with to-do lists. No matter how you prioritise your list, all the tasks there still take up the\nsame amount of physical space (a line of A4 paper), and so end up taking the same amount of mental space.\n\nBut not all tasks are equally important.\n\nAny associated with subjects that are currently in the top right quadrant, where you’re understanding and\nenjoying the work, are a little less important than the tasks associated with the bottom left.\n\nHave a look at the tasks you’ve got for subjects in the top right quadrant.

Any favours you can call in or people\nyou can ask for help?\n\n(Your aim is to buy yourself some time by working super-efciently in the subjects that are currently going well.)",

Inevitably, there are going to be moments when you have too much to do and not enough time to do it in. Here’s where an action priority matrix can be super-useful. It’s a real lifesaver because it allows you to diferentiate between tasks according to how much impact they are going to have on your learning relative to the amount of energy they’ll need to get them fnished.\nThe grid looks like this:\nIf you’ve got too much to do, try plotting all your possible actions on this grid. List everything you could be\ndoing to prepare for the next two or three exams. Now weight them:\nFirst, consider how much energy they’ll\nrequire. Energy means high concentration, focused time. If it’s lots, put the action towards the right. If you\ncould do it quickly and easily, put the action towards the left.\nSecond, consider the potential impact on your learning. If it’s high – if you feel the action could really transform\nyour knowledge or skills – put it up towards the top. If you think it will improve your learning a little, put it\ntowards the bottom.\nOnce you’ve got all your possible options on the grid, have a look at which of the four quadrants the actions\nhave fallen into and check out the advice below:\n\n\t\n\tQuick Wins\n\tThese are gold. Get them done as a matter of urgency! They won’t take long, and they could well transform\nyour performance in a particular subject. If you’ve got an afternoon ahead of you (maybe even a full day, lucky\nyou!), get these tasks done while you’re feeling fresh and lively. Set a time limit for them – say to yourself, \n\t‘I’ll\ndo this task in thirty minutes’ or ‘I’ll give myself an hour to get this finished.’\n\t Don’t consider any other activities\non the grid until you’ve bust through all of these. \n\t\n\t\n\tBaby Steps\n\t\n\tThese tasks won’t take much effort but neither will they have a massive impact. However, they could be good\ntasks to do if you’re feeling foggy or lacking energy. They might not require total concentration, so if you need\nsomething to do just to get you into the rhythm of working, choose one or two. Similarly, if you’ve got a spare\nhalf an hour before lunch, or a spare twenty minutes before your bus, you could fire off one of these. Try\ndoing one on the way into school for an exam – on a bus or train or in an environment that’s not great for total\nconcentration. \n\t\n\t\n\tMajor Projects\n\t\n\tThese are going to really boost your understanding and skill in a particular subject, but they’re going to take a\nlong period of high concentration to complete. Choose them if you can fulfill the following criteria:\n\t\n\t\tYou have two to three hours where you won’t be interrupted.\n\t\tYou’re committed to switching of all mobile devices for two to three hours, and you won’t allow yourself to\nbe distracted no matter what.\n\t\t\n\t\tYou have access to a reasonably calm and quiet working environment. \n\tIf you can’t fulfil these criteria, either change things so you can (i.e. call and cancel a meet-up, pull out of another commitment or switch location) or break the activities up. We’ve seen pupils have real success by taking a sledgehammer to a big project and bashing it into five or six smaller pieces. So instead of ‘reread the complete chemistry textbook’ (definitely a ‘major project’!), pupils have broken the task down into ‘reread chapter 1 and make notes’ or ‘reread sections 4 and 5, picking out key ideas’. Suddenly, the big project becomes a set of smaller tasks that might end up in ‘quick win’ or ‘baby steps\n\t\n\tHard Slogs\n\t\n\tIf you’re really pushed for time, the chances are you’ll end up not doing these; all your energies should be spent on getting your quick wins done, building up a load of activities in baby steps or breaking your big\nprojects down into more manageable tasks.\nWatch out, though – sometimes we might put an activity into \n\t‘hard slog’ because we just don’t want to do it.\n\tCould it be that you’ve subconsciously underestimated the impact the task could have on your learning?\n\tOnly\nkeep the task in ‘hard slogs’ if you’re super-sure.\nIt’s worth using this grid throughout May and June just to check in with yourself, work out what you could be\ndoing and picking off those tasks which will have the highest impact.\n\t\nComplete the following task to practice using the Action Priority Matrix.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nIt’s well worth reviewing the kind of work you do and thinking about the impact it has. Some pupils use the grid and realise they spend lots of time doing high efort low impact jobs. Others often fgure out that they’re doing lots of low efort low impact jobs over and over again.Have you got a particular pattern of working? How might you improve it?

But even at the start of a year, it’s\nworth taking stock of your week.\n\n\tWhat does a typical week look like for you? \n\tWhere are the gaps (if there are\nully) or are you over-committed? \n\t\nWe recently did this with a pupil who was starting to feel very stressed, he was a highly motivated competitive swimmer with a lot of commitments. His original timetable is shown below:\n\nIt became very clear why he was feeling stressed – he literally didn’t have a spare minute! To find additional time to get on top of his\nschool work, the only option would have been for him to sleep less (not something we would recommend!). \n\t\nIt\nwas apparent that he was committed to too many activities: he was training 7 times\na week, including competitions most Saturday's, he also volunteered at a kids activity sessions and was working for his uncle in his shop for eight hours over the weekend He was clearly going to burn out before\nhe got to Christmas!\nAfter speaking to him we helped to re-design his timetable\n\nAfter discussing his priorities it became clear that swimming was very important to him, he was close to his national time and didn't want to reduce his training. The extra work with his uncle gave him money but he realised that he needed to scale that back now. He really enjoyed the voluntary work but the weekend session was the best, so this remained and the midweek sessions were dropped.In the following activity we would like you to review your current weekly timetable.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nThis is an ideal opportunity to refect on the time you have and the way you’re using it. Have a look at the questions and see if they help you make some decisions about how to change your week:",

The actor Will Smith is a great example of someone who claims he doesn’t have much talent and it’s his work ethic that separates him from the rest. Here’s what he says about hard work:\n\"The only thing that I see that is distinctly diferent about me is I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period.You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things – you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there’s two things: you’re getting of frst or I’m going to die. It’s really that simple, right?\"\nThe effort thermometer is a way of getting you to keep track of how hard you’re working. The frst thing you have to decide is what are high levels of effort.\nIt might be best if you do this activity with your tutor group or ask few a friends for their thoughts.\nNext to ‘high effort’ write down what the high effort pupils are doing. (We’ve done this activity a number of times before. Here are the kinds of things we often get back:\n\n\tDoes 10 hours of revision each week,\n\tAlways stays focused in class\n\tWorks hard in every lesson\n\tDoes additional work on top of homework\n\tAsks teachers questions to fix misunderstandings\n\tAttends lunchtime sessions or after-school catch-ups\nNext, you then need to do the same for average effort and low efortpupils. How are the behaviours in these categories diferent?\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nTry setting short term goals to help you boost your efort. Instead of thinking “This is how hard I’m going to have to work for the rest of the year!”, which can be a daunting prospect, you might instead set yourself a date where you take a mini-break.\nTry working harder for three or four days before rewarding yourself. Then work for five days at a new level of efort. Then eight or nine. Try for longer and longer periods, building in breaks. These mini-breaks help break-up the time ahead of you and keep you motivated\nWatch Will Smith's motivational talk below:",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nLife is full of decisions. Each day we make thousands; estimates range between 3,000 for young children to approximately 35,000 for adults. We all experience something called decision fatigue – a decrease in the quality of our decisions over a long period of decision making. (That’s why those decisions we make at 10pm after a full day at school might not be our best!) It’s partly because we often spend a lot of our decision making energy throughout the day on small material decisions – whether to buy this chocolate or that chocolate, what to eat for lunch and where to sit, how to spend a small amount of money, which bus to catch home and so on.\nOften, our material decisions have taken up a lot of mental energy, leaving our behavioural decisions as unplanned reactions. So when a teacher challenges the quality of your homework, it feels unexpected and you might get angry even though you know you shouldn’t. Or a friend asks you to skip an after-school class and you blurt out, ‘Yes!’ even though you know it’s a bad idea.\nThis activity allows you to anticipate some of those decisions and to ‘pre-make’ them. Use the decision making energy you’ve got now to plan out responses to future events, and make decisions now that represent the best possible future you.\nFirst, consider these questions and use the space below to answer them:\n\n\tWhat kind of person do you want to be?\n\tWhat qualities do you want to have?\n\tWhat’s important to you?\n\tWhat do you want other people to say about you?\n\tWhat ideals do you want your strong, confident decisions to be based on?\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nOne way to focus your mind on making good decisions is to recall times where you’ve made bad ones.\nEveryone can look back on a bad decision they’ve made, and the experience of reviewing it can help us figure out things to avoid in future.\nTry recalling a bad decision. Focus on key details like – Who was there? Where were you? What time of day was it? What was the exact point at which the poor decision was made? Why was the decision made that\nway?

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡We’ve worked with thousands of pupils who are great at designing revision; they create amazing revision and independent work plans that fill every minute of the day, but then just don’t follow through on the plan.\nIt’s something we’ve all done; if you have too, don’t beat yourself up about it. Why do we procrastinate? Why do we avoid putting the efort in?\nThis might surprise you, but saying that you are going to do some ‘independent work’ or ‘revision’ is actually part of the problem. When you say that you are going to revise (as far as your brain is concerned), it’s vague and ambiguous. When your brain thinks that you are about to do something that’s vague and ambiguous it will often start to come up with reasons why you shouldn’t do it (which can be quite useful). This probably sounds a bit odd, but your brain starts thinking that this isn’t really a well thought-out plan. It’s not sure what you are going to be doing, or how, and your brain starts to get you thinking that it might not even work. Then you procrastinate.\nSo how do you get past this?It’s quite a simple strategy but we promise you it works. You have to get specifc. Here’s how. Before every independent work session or revision session you have to sit down and answer these three questions:\n\n\tHow am I going to revise/work?\n\t\n\t\tHere you have to be specifc about the how (what strategy you are going to use) and also what you are going to revise. This means identifying specifcally the topics you are going to cover, and the activities you’re going to do to cover the work\n\t\n\tHow long am I going to revise/work for?\n\t\n\t\tBe very clear about the time. If you are doing active revision this shouldn’t be any longer than two hours.Remember to build in short (ten minute) breaks every forty minutes. Use 25 minute sprints (page xx) to help structure sessions, and it becomes even easier to beat procrastination.\n\t\n\tHow will I know if I’ve made progress?\n\t\n\t\tHow are you going to test yourself? If you just sit for two hours passively reading your notes you will have no idea if you have made any progress, so you’ll need to test yourself in some way. It might be a set of questions you answer, a mini-lecture that you give to yourself, or a short-answer questions you’re going to do under timed conditions towards the end of the session.\n\t\nThis activity begins the process of building this into a habit whenever you revise.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nOnce you’ve done this a few times, you might start noticing certain revision sessions that feel easier than others.\nWatch out for sessions that feel too straightforward and too easy. Often they’re the result of planning an activity that isn’t very challenging, and that is quite simple and often pretty boring to complete. When you’re working, try asking yourself, “Would my strictest teachers let me get away with doing this for an hour?”If the answer is “No,” it might be that you need to step up the challenge a little. That way, you can get more done in less time.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡Often, our perception of our own efort is inaccurate. We frequently judge it by the people we surround ourselves with. So, if someone asked you how hard you are working, you might think about your three closest friends, figure out how you’re doing compared to them and then give an answer. This is fine if all your friends are really hard working. If not, you might be kidding yourself that you’re doing enough work.\nIt can be useful to do a checklist to review how hard you are working and see if you need to make any changes.\nHave a go. First, you need to look at the behaviours listed below and then decide is this something you do consistently (at least once every week), sometimes (at least every three weeks to a month) or rarely (once a term or even never). Then you have to decide whether you think this is a development need (something you should improve). If you think that it’s something you should consider as a development need, your final task is to prioritise it as either high, medium or low, depending on how you think it will impact your performance.\n\n\tI always hand my homework in on time.\n\tI leave things until the last minute.\n\tI do the minimum amount of work I can get away with.\n\tI hand in extra exam work for marking.\n\tIn most classes my main goal is to do the minimum needed so I don’t have to work very hard.\n\tI work hard at home.\n\tI do ten hours a week of independent study at home.\nThe next step is to decide what you are happy with and what you aren’t happy with.\nThis activity uses the analogy of packing your bags for a holiday. Imagine you’re leaving the present you behind and moving to a new you. There are going to be some things that you want to take with you – elements of your current habits and work practices that you really like  – and some things that you will defnitely\nwant to leave behind – things that annoy you about yourself or end up causing you stress and anxiety.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsSometimes, after setting a date, a pupil has a setback. They forget their new pattern of behaviour just for a day, and things go wrong. When that happens, it’s tempting to abandon the whole plan. Don’t do that! Ifsomething goes wrong and you slip, just put it behind you, and commit to starting again the following day.\nSometimes there are two or three false starts before you crack it!",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡Sometimes facing the reality of a situation can seem daunting. We all hide from the facts sometimes – we know something needs changing but it can seem easier just not to make the change. Here’s a good metaphor for exploring this further. Have you ever wandered down a beach and lifted up some rocks? It can be quite scary but good fun.You never quite know what you are going to fnd. To begin with there seems to be no sign of life. Then you lift a rock and all sorts of squidgy creatures come out – little worms, crabs, snails, sea anemones or even the odd fish. More often than not people put the rock back down and move on, preferring not to spend too much time looking at what’s underneath. But sometimes in life we have to look under the rocks to make progress.\nThis technique is used a lot in business. A researcher and writer called Jim Collins, in his book Good to Great,found that all successful companies face the brutal facts of reality, looking under the rocks for problems, even when they don’t want to!\nThis activity is going to feel uncomfortable but by the end of it you will have a plan to make things better.\nThe Steps:\n\n\tStep 1 - Identify any issues you think are under the rocks. This means taking some time and being\nreally, brutally honest with yourself.\n\t\n\tStep 2 - The second step requires a group of four good, trusted, friends. Position yourself so that you are facing the group. You\nare then going to share your issue for change and the rest of the group are going to ask you questions and\nmaybe ofer some solutions. Listen carefully during this feedback. We quite often think that we can’t change\nsomething simply because we have run out of ideas.Now you’ve had a long, critical look at your progress you might be feeling pretty bruised. Take a break, go for a walk, watch TV, treat yourself to ice cream.\n\t\nOnce you have, it’s time for the third step:Step 3 - Taking action. What exactly can you do to\nimprove matters?\nYou might know all about origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. Those who do it can make beautiful and complex 3D models, many of which look incredible and even have moving parts. Despite these amazing constructions, the process is just a series of simple steps repeated over and over again. Every origami masterpiece begins with a single fold in a piece of paper, followed by another and another and another.It’s the same with academic learning.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡Effort is just a habit.\nPupils who have the efort habit have created a weekly routine of repeated activities that allow them to respond to teacher requests (homework) and reinforce learning (independent work). Pupils without the efort habit have little or no routine and respond to work as and when it hits them.\nIncreasing your levels of effort can be a tiring task because it means moving away from a comfortable and familiar way of working into a less comfortable one. So rewarding yourself for increased levels of effort is hugely important. Parents and teachers might not spot the change in your work patterns right away, so it will be up to you to give yourself a pat on the back.\nThat’s where mission and medal comes in: the mission is the work, the medal is the reward! This activity helps you to design and structure an effortful week of work that you can then repeat until it becomes a routine.\nPretty soon you won’t be the only person rewarding yourself – teachers, tutors and parents will spot your new routine and you’ll be in line for some praise!\nStep 1: Audit of a typical week.\nBefore you design your mission and medal week, you need to figure out what’s currently happening. In the boxes on the following page, record what you do with your time during a typical week.\nStep 2: Create a Mission and Medal Week\nFor five of the seven days, set yourself a sixty-minute mission. It could be one of the following:\n\n\tComplete homework, \n\tPlan ahead, \n\tConsolidate learning, \n\tOrganise notes, \n\tResearch sixth form colleges, \n\tFill out an application \n\tBegin a revision guide. \nComplete the mission all at once or in parts. Choose times of day when you work well – without distractions. For the same five days, set aside a medal to be awarded on completion of the mission. It might be a session on your games console, a TV programme, a football match, some time on social media, something nice to eat or drink or some favourite music. Vary your medals.\nDon’t forget to assign yourself two bonus medals – a mid-weeker to pep you up and a Sunday-nighter to get you feeling good for the week. These medals should be a little larger than your regular medals.\nStep 3 - Building a Scoreboard\nThere’s a lot of conflicting research about how long it takes to create a habit. Unless you keep track you’ll have no idea. Now you’ve devised a mission and medal week, you can use a scoreboard as a simple way of\nhelping you with motivation. We developed this idea after hearing the American comedian Jerry Seinfeld talk about how he writes jokes.\nHe sets himself the goal of writing a joke every day and keeps a diary to check off when he’s been successful. His argument is that once you see the days being ticked off, you don’t want to see the pattern being broken, so you keep going. After a few weeks, this new behaviour just becomes a habit and you might not even need to think about it – you just do it!\nSo, for every day you follow your mission and medal programme, you simply tick off the days. You’ll need a monthly calendar like the one below.\n\nUse the following activity to aufid your week and commit to trying a new, mission and medal week soon.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts\nReactive missions are those set for you by others. It might be your teacher insisting on a finished piece of work by Friday, a tutor asking you to complete an application form, or your mum reminding you to do a job at home.\nBut what about proactive missions – targets you actually set yourself? Try this. Finish the following sentence:",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\n\n\n\nThere’s a very famous book by Italian entrepreneur and author Francesco Cirillo called The Pomodoro Technique. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. (The tomato in question is one of those novelty kitchen timers, not a real one!) We’ll come back to the tomato in a bit.\n\nIn his book, Cirillo argues that we can generate lots of energy and efort by working in short bursts, even on long tasks that we don’t feel motivated to do. Think of all the tasks you’ve got to do that you just can’t bear to begin – there might be revision notes, essays to write, jumbled notes to fle away or a piece of coursework to start. Choose one that’s become a bit of a nightmare for you – that’s hanging over your head and you just don’t want to do. Make a note of it first.\n\nStep 1\nNow for the tomato. By which we mean getting hold of either a kitchen timer (needless to say, it doesn’t have to be shaped like anything in particular!) or the timer on your phone.\n Find somewhere quiet. Arrange the things you need to begin. You’re going to do a twenty-fve minute sprint. It’s important to tell yourself this: twenty-fve minutes – that’s all. You’re allowed no distractions whatsoever in that twenty-fve minutes. Don’t worry. You can be back on social media in twenty-fve minutes’ time, checking\nupdates and messages. Now start the timer and go!\n\nStep 2\nCongratulations! You’ve got that nightmare task started. All of a sudden, this job is going to seem less frightening. You’ll be able to come back to it. Some suggestions for messing around with the Pomodoro Technique:\n\n\n\tThe ‘Quick Sprint’: try twenty-fve minutes on, twenty-fve minutes of, twenty-fve minutes on. It takes one hour and ffteen minutes in total, and you can do it at a regular time each night after school.\n\tThe ‘Serious Sprint’. Try twenty-fve minutes on, fve minutes of, twenty-fve minutes on, fve minutes of, twenty-fve minutes on. It takes about one hour and thirty minutes, and is a useful technique for really attacking a difcult piece of work.\n\tTry measuring tasks in sprints. How many will it take? This way, you’ll develop a sense of how you work, and you can begin picking of scary tasks more quickly and easily.\n\tTry using sprints to review work. Suddenly you’ll fnd yourself ahead and on top of things. It’s a great feeling\n\n\n\nIf you are ready to try 25min Sprint nowm use the following activity.\n\nREFLECT🤔\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOne Quick Sprint per day for a week is nearly six hours’ independent work per week. One Serious Sprint per day is nearly ten hours’ independent work per week.\n\nTry using a Mission and Medal weekly planner to scope out what a week with:\n\n\n\t6 hours’ independent learning,\n\t10 hours’ independent learning\n\t15 hours’ independent learning",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡We borrowed this activity form Jack Canfeld’s book The Success Principles (2005). He is also the author of the ‘Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul’ series which we highly recommend.Canfeld employs the useful analogy of chopping down a tree when trying to achieve your goals. He says that if you take a very sharp axe and take fve swings at a tree every day, no matter how big the tree, eventually it will come down. It’s the same with any goal you set. If you take a few small steps every month towards achieving your goal, eventually you’ll get there, no matter how big the goal.Canfeld almost makes it sound inevitable. It makes you think: the reason people don’t achieve their dreams isn’t that they lack a dream, it’s that they just don’t take any action. A dream is just a dream unless you take action!This activity might seem simple, but we guarantee it’s one of the most efective tools we have ever used. All you have to do is take three steps every half-term towards achieving your long-term goal. It’s that simple. You have to decide the steps you are going to take and then commit to doing them.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final Thoughts.What if I don’t know exactly what the steps are?Here’s where research comes in. We’ve worked with hundreds of students who’ve wanted to do something we didn’t know much about. Over the years we’ve had to fnd out how to become an actor, how to get into graphic design, how to get a work-shadowing position at a games design company, and so on.Remember this – Whatever you’re trying to achieve, the chances are someone else has done it before you. It might be someone in the year above you, an older brother or sister, or a tutor or teacher. If there isn’t someone close to home, who could you contact more remotely, through email or social media?",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡There’s a famous quote, sometimes attributed to US president Abraham Lincoln, that goes like this: ‘Discipline is choosing between what you want now, and what you want most.’ .It’s a useful idea to think about because in many circumstances what we want now (to buy a pair of trainers, say) probably damages what we want most (to have enough money to go on holiday).\nMany of us will fnd ourselves choosing what we want now over what we want most; it’s human to sometimes make these choices. In fact, in some circumstances the ‘now’ choice (taking a break and forgetting our troubles for an evening) doesn’t really damage the ‘most’ goal (getting great GCSE grades), so it’s OK if we choose it. The problem comes if we continually prioritise ‘now’ over ‘most’ – if we do, we never end upreaching the goal we’ve set ourselves.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsOne way to deal with problems you know will occur, is to make an if-then plan. Take the two example behaviours you used in the task. You know for sure that these are the things you want now that will signifcantly damage the things you want most.\nAn if-then plan allows you to make a good decision about what to do when you’re next tempted. Have a look at the table below, and see if you can make an if-then plan for your damaging behaviours:\n\n\n\n\tIf...\n\t\n\tThen...\n\t\n\n\n\tI end up chatting with mates at the bus station and\nthey suggest staying out all afternoon...\n\t\n\tTell them I have to get home because there’s a family thing I can’t miss, and catch the next bus.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nSometimes setting a goal can feel like a long process. The goals can seem so distant that we don’t take any immediate action. Designing a success map can really help with this. A success map is a visual reminder of the journey you’re going on. It guides you to where you want to be and warns you about things that might pull you of course.Look at how this university student has used a dotted line to indicate the journey of her boat between the islands in this version of her jourrney to success map:\n\nThere are two main elements here – the positive and the negative. Have a look at how the student emphasises positive things that are going to help: ‘Peaceful Bay’, ‘Exercise’, ‘Up Early!’, ‘Mind Maps’ and ‘Tutors to the Rescue!’ And hazards to watch out for: ‘Loss of Focus’, ‘Sharks of Disillusionment’ and ‘Sea Monsters of Personal Disaster’.\nYou can do the same on your map:\n\n\tMapping your support - Surround your pathway with good things that will encourage and help you. Rewards, celebrations and holidays all need marking on the map. Think about the people who might support you too. Could you ask friends, a mentor or your parents/guardian? Write the names of these people in your ‘support team’ box.\n\tMapping your challenges. Here you should include the things you’re going to need to watch out for. They should be specifc to you – your bad habits! It might be laziness, procrastination, worry or distraction.\nUnlike the example above, we’ve found it useful to add dates to the map so you know what happens when in the year ahead.Once done, it’s a good idea to keep your map on display somewhere that you can always see it. This will help to remind you of the steps that need to be completed to reach that destination in the distance!Use the following activity to help plan out yoursuccess roadmap\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsIt doesn’t matter whether you travel by land, air or sea, when you are working towards your goals you can expect some bumps that knock you of course. This is normal, so don’t feel too stressed if you end up shipwrecked for a short time on procrastination island. It can be useful to record how you got over or past these sticking points. This way, you can use the same strategy if you fnd yourself there again. For example:\n\n\tWas there a teacher or tutor who gave advice or changed your thinking\n\tDid a friend help out by lending notes or giving encouragement?\n\tDid you change the time or place you worked – by attending extra classes or staying behind after school?\nUse the table below to refect on how things have gone and how you dealt with the bumps in the road so far.",

This obstacle – this frustrating, unfortunate,problematic, unexpected problem preventing you from doing what you want to do ... What if it wasn’t so bad?\" The obstacle is the way, Ryan Holiday (2015)\nDeciding what your goals are and making a plan can, quite often, be the easy bit. We usually set of with good intentions and then boom, we get hit with an obstacle or a number of obstacles that slow us down or in some cases stop us from following through on our goals. The frst thing to remember is that this is completely normal.\nAs Ryan Holiday says in the quote above, if you have a goal worth pursuing it’s likely that there are going to be some obstacles on the route. So don’t beat yourself up about it. Accept this as part of the journey and plan a way through – it might not be that bad!\nSometimes these obstacles can be completely out of our control – a sudden change of circumstances in our life such as illness or family problems, for example. However, we sometimes think that these obstacles are out of our control when in fact we might be able to do something about them. This activity is one to do if you fnd that you’re not making the progress you hoped for.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsFor the frst few times you use this tool it’s best if you write the obstacles down. With enough practice you’ll start to go through this process naturally in your mind. You’ll fnd that with practice, rather than hitting a wall and suddenly stopping, you’ll fnd a way around your obstacle.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\n\n\n\nEntrepreneur Derek Silvers argues that to have a single, specific goal in mind can be limiting – because if obstacles keep cropping up to stop us, we eventually abandon this single, specific goal. Instead of a specific goal, he argues that we should spend our lives pursuing the answer to a problem. That’s our purpose in life.\n\nThis is a better way to goal set because even when obstacles block our way, we find another route towards solving our chosen problem – of pursuing our purpose.\n\nFor example, here are two pretty similar pupils:\n\n\n\tPupil 1 has a super-specific goal: I want to study medicine at Manchester University and become a doctor.\n\tPupil 2 has a problem that fascinates them: how can we improve healthcare in the UK?\n\nOf course, each pupil will encounter obstacles along their way. But if pupil 1 doesn’t get the grades to study medicine at Manchester, the route to their goal is blocked. If the same thing happens to pupil 2, they will find a different route to solving the problem that fascinates them; they may do voluntary work, start a nursing course, choose a degree that covers public healthcare systems or research the politics of healthcare.\n\nSilvers says that if we can express our goals as problems we’re trying to solve, we always know when we’re heading in the right direction and we tend not to be put of by obstacles.\n\nLet’s build a compass. Your true north is the problem that most fascinates you – the one you should always be heading towards. Let’s call this your lead problem. Around true north (north-east, north-west) are other problems that are close to your lead problem – perhaps different versions of your lead problem. If you’re heading in this direction you’re still doing OK. Around the other compass points (east, south and west) are distractions – things you shouldn’t be pursuing, even if other people think you should. If you’re going in these directions, you'll need to turn back\n\nCover the compass points with notes. Problems that interest or fascinate you go at or near your true north. Distractions go elsewhere, with the biggest at the south – the opposite direction to your true north.\n\nExample problems to consider, discuss or discard include:\n\n\n\tHow do we make the distribution of wealth in the UK fairer?\n\tHow can we save larger numbers of species from extinction?\n\tHow might we design buildings that increase people’s happiness and well-being?\n\tWhat are the elements necessary for a superb movie?\n\tHow can we improve pupils’ experience of school, college or university?\n\tHow can the design of ______ be improved?\n\tHow can we accelerate our progress towards curing ______?\n\tHow can art be used to improve people’s lives?\n\tWhat qualities are necessary for huge success in ______?\n\tHow can I create popular, immersive, interactive computer games?\n\tHow can we reduce crime by working with young offenders?\n\tWhat qualities make some ______ better than others?\n\tHow can we help people cope with difficult, stressful or traumatic times in their lives?\n\tWhat does outstanding parenting/teaching look like?\n\t How can we discover more about the workings of the universe?\n\tHow do we solve global warming?\n\tWhat does augmented/virtual reality mean for media/entertainment/gaming?\n\tHow can we work more efficiently using artificial intelligence?\n\nOnce you have thought of the big questions you would like to answer in your life then move onto the activity page...\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsPurpose goals tend to be more magnetic and motivating than status goals. Have a look at these examples to see the diference:Purpose: I see a lot of inequality in the way we are educated and prepared for work, and I want to help tackle that issueStatus: I want to earn a lot, take long holidays and have a big houseYou might want both of these things. And when times get tough (as they do for everyone at some point!) you’d be forgiven for thinking it would be the status goal that gets you through. But our experience shows it will most likely be the sense of purpose that keeps you moving forwards.So make sure you’re working on developing your sense of purpose. It’s going to come in useful!",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡Sometimes, it’s easier to express the motivations and desires that are important to us rather than the jobs or courses that might fulfil them. Professor Steven Reiss, who worked as a psychologist at Ohio State University, conducted studies with over 6,000 people to try to define their underlying motivations. He concluded his work by suggesting there are sixteen different motivations that guide all human behaviour. We’ve adjusted his list a little to make it more accessible and easy to work with. There are fifteen in ours.Study the list below and decide which seem like they might be most important to you. Once you’ve shortlisted nine of the fifteen, you then have to prioritise them using the diamond. At the top of the diamond, leading the others, should be the motivation that beats all others for you. Underneath, you can have two deputies alongside each other. Then come the rest, in total 15 possible motivations:Acceptance: the need for approval, support and good feeling from those around you.Competition: the need to pit yourself against others – to compete and win.Curiosity: the need to learn, explore, research, discover and try new things.Creativity: the need to design, write, draw, build – to create art or entertainment. Family: the need to raise or help children, to nurture others or to work in small, loyal units supporting those around you.Honour: the need to be loyal to the key values of a group or society – to observe the rules, do what is expected and guide others in these values.Idealism: the need for fairness, equality and social justice.Independence: the need for individuality – the ability to organise and run things your way.Order: the need for organised, stable, predictable environments; creating routines and patterns.Physical activity: the need for movement, exercise and physical challenge.Power: the need for influence, the ability to determine the direction of others; the responsibility for the performance of groups.Saving: the need to collect things, to own things and categorise or order them.Social contact: the need for friends, to have extensive peer relationships.Social status: the need to appear to be of a high social standing or a person of importance.Tranquillity: the need to be calm, relaxed and safe.\n\nREFLECT🤔The nature of our working lives are changing. People used to choose a profession or trade, and stick to it for the entirety of their working lives. Now, employment is much more fluid. The Telegraph newspaper recently summarised a study which showed people will, on average, work for six different employers and have between ten and twenty five job interviews before they retire. 45% of us will be made redundant at least once. 46% of us will re-train completely and switch careers as we seek greater satisfaction.So your experience will be different from that of your parents and teachers. Opportunities, careers and jobs will emerge that didn’t exist twenty years ago, and you’ll switch between them more regularly.Bearing all of that in mind, have a go at this light-hearted thought experiment. Don’t limit your thinking!If you had to design a crazy, impossible, perfect job that satisfied your top three motivations, what would it be?",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nThis activity has been used successfully with adults experiencing difficulties in their work or personal life. It’s a balancing exercise that frees up the mind and lets you make sense of hundreds of competing thoughts, ideas, worries and fears. So, if you’re in a muddle, if you’re struggling to feel positive or if you’re feeling gloomy, this one might work for you.\nThe human brain works more effectively with good blood flow, so walking is essential to this activity. After your walk, you will need half an hour to collect your thoughts, jotting things down and making notes. Alternatively, you can use the voice recorder on a mobile phone to record your thoughts and ideas as you go. For this activity to work, you need to be disciplined and follow the following rules to the letter!\n\nInstructions\n\tBlock out an hour of your time. You must be alone and undisturbed for this hour.\n\tChoose a destination that is about twenty minutes’ walk away. While you walk there, you can only think positive thoughts. Your topic is: \"things I am good at and things I am thankful for.\" Nothing else can enter your mind. Bully yourself into staying on these two topics.\n\tRecord your thoughts or list them quickly on a notepad.Then turnaround and return to your start point.\n\tWhile you walk back, you can address the problems you think you have, but here is the rule – your topic is: \"things I can do to solve my problems.\"\n\tBe strong with yourself. This is the only thing you can think about. When you arrive back, take a few minutes alone and make a note of your thoughts and ideas.\nA final thought: worry is a call to action. If you’re worrying, make a list of actions and then act on what you have listed. If you don’t change things, things don’t change.\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsThis is a very satisfying activity if you finish it with an action – something you’ve listed in the right-hand column – that you do as soon as you get back.\nRepeat the activity even if your lists remain the same. The recording of positives on the left, and plans on the right, is very inspiring!",

In essence, he argues that those who surround themselves with good people become good – those who surround themselves with hard working people become hard working. Equally, those who surround themselves with lazy people become lazy.\n\nThis is something we see every year: promising students who have a friendship group which almost enforces disengagement. The group will effectively mock or punish any group member who is enjoying study, succeeding or working hard. It’s sometimes difficult to tell if it’s happening to you, and by the time you’ve figured it out it can be too late.\nThe Vampire Test\nWriter and artist Austin Kleon has a solution.\nHe calls it the Vampire Test, and he explains it in his book, \"Show your Work!\"  Kleon advises that; ‘if, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire’ (2014, p. 129).\nWatch the video below to learn more about the Vampre Test:\n\nREFLECT🤔Final ThoughtsWe’ve seen students who are feeling negative about the challenges of study respond by surrounding themselves with negative people so they can wallow in complaining.\nYou must guard against this, because it makes you feel as if \"everyone hates 6th form\", and normalises your negativity. Think of a student who seems more positive, happy or energetic, and try to align yourself with them instead.",

Kübler-Ross proposed that a terminally ill patient would progress through certain stages of grief when informed of their illness.\nNowadays, the curve is used to help people understand their reactions to significant change in their lives.\nStarting Post 16 study is a significant change in any student’s life and, like any change, it’s likely that you will experience some of the following feelings.\nApplication of Change curve to the transition fromn Key Stage 4 to Key Stage 5:Think about your responses at Level 3. We’ve heard things like this:\n\tRejection: ‘I don’t believe what you’re telling me about Level 3study. It doesn’t seem any different.I’ll carry on as normal.’\n\tDenial/minimisation: ‘I’m fine. It’ll be alright. Stop hassling me about how different it is.’\n\tAnger: ‘I actually hate this. The teachers are rubbish. The subjects are nothing like they said they would be. I wish I’d never started or gone to that other college.’\n\tBlame self: ‘It turns out I’m just not clever enough to do this.’\n\tAnxiety: ‘Everyone else is better than me. I’m missing deadlines. I’m not sleeping well. I don’t understand the work. I’m not enjoying this challenge at all. I’m scared I’ll fail.’\n\tEmotional fog: Withdrawing effort. Giving up.\n\tAcceptance/letting go: ‘Things are different now. It’s hard, but I’m getting to grips with it.’\n\tExperiment/consolidate/get on with it: ‘I’m getting better at this. My grades aren’t great but they’re improving. There are some parts of these courses I like.’\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsWe’ve seen students get stuck in an early phase of the change curve for a long time – weeks and months – where they repeat the same complaints and worries.\nIf this is you, or someone you know, try our Stopping Negative Thoughts activity",

But what happens if the position of the bin is adjusted to three-and-a-half yards? Or four yards?\nNow the second group are in a better position because they’ve practised differently – more flexibly.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for your Study?The throws are like exam questions or assessments. Some students prepare for ‘standard assessments’ only. They’re great at these predictable questions – like three yard throws. But if the exam or assessment asks something slightly different, they’re in trouble. They can have nightmare exam experiences. They will often say, ‘The question was slightly different! It totally messed with my concentration! I didn’t know what to do!’ Students who practise flexibly start to think flexibly. They will say, ‘The questions were a bit weird. Eventually I worked out what I needed to do though.’\nSo make sure you mix it up in practice. Researchers call this ‘interleaved practice’; practice that forces you to switch tasks regularly. It’s slower to begin with, but the long-term benefits are that you become flexible in your thinking, and you can handle unexpected questions.\nSo why not challenge yourself to:\nSeek out the weirdest questions that have ever come up and try them.Create your own strange questions.Visit the website of a different exam board and try their questions instead.The following activity is about starting this research now and starting to think about some curveball questions for yourself........\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsThese weird, unpredictable exam questions are sometimes referred to as ‘curveballs’. They’re disorientating and can derail even confident students. But challenging, flexible practice will mean you can cope.\nWe always fondly remember an ace mathematician we worked with. On the day of his final exam he was supremely confident – convinced there wasn’t a curveball he hadn’t already seen. And he was right; he didn’t drop a single mark. Afterwards, when we interviewed him, it turned out the exam he’d just taken was the fifteenth paper he’d completed under timed conditions in the fortnight before the exam.\nYou too can be that well prepared!",

After some time working on a drill, players might then play a game in which the particular skill is tested.\nDoes this work with study too? With a maths problem or a history essay? The answer is yes.\n\n\n\n1. Go slow.To begin with you should try the equivalent of a drill. You’re taking out the stress, worry and complexity, so you’re not thinking about the chaos and uncertainty of doing an exam. You’re going slowly, paying attention to what you do. That might mean taking half an hour to work through a short answer exam question, twenty minutes on a maths problem, an hour on a couple of science questions or half an hour writing a single killer paragraph for an essay.\n2. Go fast.Then you can try to apply the learning in a ‘game’ situation – in other words, under exam conditions.

His findings can be applied to mistakes we make whenever we do something challenging. Luckily, the mistakes you make don’t have any serious consequences – at least not compared to an air crash.If you want to accelerate the speed at which you get good at something, it helps if you do the following:\n\n\tMake mistakes - This may sound obvious but some students feel frightened or depressed when they make mistakes, so they avoid making them. If a piece of work is difficult and they are likely to make lots of mistakes, they copy someone else’s or ‘forget’ to hand it in. You must make mistakes so you can learn from them.\n\tOnce the error is made, grab it - Mistakes are information. Don’t ignore them, hide them or quickly correct them. Study them.\n\tCategorise your mistake and work out why it happened - Professor Reason argues that there are three broad reasons for error:\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsJust the act of getting all your feedback together in one place is a really useful activity. Many students have lots of teacher feedback, but it’s scattered across nine or ten different pieces of work jammed into bags or stranded in different files.\nAudit your teacher feedback and you stand a much better chance of working effectively on your weaknesses.",

Information won’t help you pass an exam or master a skill.\nOn the right, you can see that knowledge is connected information.The job of any learner is to turn information into knowledge.\nSo how do we build these connections to turn information into knowledge?One way is by reorganising pieces of information.\nGraphic organisers can help you do this. Some are very simple:\n\n\tMake a mind-map of the information.\n\tMake a comparison table and pull out similarities and differences between two studies, methods, people, characters or historical events.\n\tMake a flow chart to summarise a process or series of events.\n\tMake a graph to represent the data.\nNotice the focus on action here – each of our suggestions begins with ‘make’. That’s you being active, engaging with information and reorganising it so it becomes knowledge.\nAlternatively you can use complex graphic organisers. They usually take the form of a metaphor, where you turn something into something else.\nFor example, summarise everything you know about a topic using the metaphor of a tree.\nTREE GRAPHIC ORGANISER:\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsBy recasting and reorganising information, you’re building strong neural connections in your brain, and really mastering the content of your subject.\nBut remember, mastering content is only the first step! The minute you feel confident, you must move on to skills practice and feedback. Check the Revision Questionnaire activity to see what activities you should be completing next.\nBelow is an infographic which will help you select the most appropriate graphic organiser to use. At the bottom of the page we have also included a folder containing some of our favourite graphic organiser templates for you to download and use.\nREMEMBER - BE CREATIVE - The act of creating the graphic organiser helps embed the knowledge into your brain.\nGRAPHIC ORGANISER TEMPLATES - LINK",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nOne way to burn understanding into your brain, particularly a skill, is to find someone who does it well. It might be your teacher or a fellow student, someone in your class or someone in the year above.\nFind an example of them doing it right. It might be a complex mathematical problem worked through, a definition and example question in social science, a perfect paragraph or a calculation in chemistry or physics.\nOnce you’ve got the example, you can do the following activity. We’ve found it works well at helping students see the difference between a successful answer and unsuccessful answer by making you focus on the differences between wrong and right.\nThe principle is very simple. It goes like this:\n\tUsing your example, copy the skill - You must do it right. It might be that you write a paragraph that borrows the best bits from the example you’ve got, or you might solve a very similar mathematical problem following your example.\n\tThen do it wrong. Do it the way you’ve been doing it. - Examine the differences. Where exactly do you go wrong? What is the result of that error? Where does it lead? How does wrong look different?\n\tThen copy the skill right again. - You go – right, wrong, right. The two rights start to burn the understanding into your brain. The wrong in the middle helps you see why the wrong is wrong.\nIsolating the ErrorsIt’s worth spending some time looking at the differences between the two rights and the wrong. Try to make a list of three or four things that the right is doing that the wrong wasn’t. This activity will help you do this......\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsA simple way to summarise your learning here is to record:\n\n\tSomething you need to do more of. (More regular quotation? More academic terminology? More references to studies? More evaluation of sources? More careful checking of calculations?)\n\tAnd something you need to do less of.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡The Leitner Box, which was developed by a German scientist called Sebastian Leitner, is a really effective, easy-to-develop practice and recall system. It’s based on using flash cards to learn and then recall information, so this activity will need a whole bunch of subject-related flash cards. The cards are used as normal to record quick, easy-to-read bullet-pointed information about topics.Leitner suggests that when we have a large amount of information to learn on flash cards, we have a tendency to gravitate towards the cards we already know and subconsciously avoid those we find difficult. To circumvent this, you create four subsections in your box (or four separate boxes):\n\n\tBox 1. - Here you put items for frequent practice. This is the stuff you’re not remembering well – it needs regular review and rereading because you’re making mistakes when you practise recalling it or you don’t know it at all. Around 40% of your time should be spent hammering the content of these cards.When you score a victory and fully recall a card, you move it down to box 2.\n\tBox 2. - About 30% of your time is spent here. It’s the stuff you’ve only just moved out of box 1 or learning that still trips you up or confuses you in any way. This material should be moving up (if you’re not remembering it) or down (if you’ve nailed it) fairly regularly.\n\tBox 3. - You spend 20% of your time here, and you nearly always get this stuff correct when you test yourself on it. You feel confident, even when the material is complex. However, if you dip in here and make any mistakes in recall at all, the card must be moved into box 2.\n\tBox 4. - You begin with only a small number of cards here. This is the material you consider easy. You always get it right, so you only need to spend 10% of your time checking stuff in this box. However, and this is key, nothing ever leaves this box because you know it so well. No matter how confident you feel, you still check it every now and again.\nAnimation explaining the Leitner System:\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsIf there’s one quality we’ve seen that differentiates top performing students from others, it’s the courage and determination to spend time focusing on weaknesses. This activity helps you isolate where your attention needs to be. It may be uncomfortable, but it will make a huge difference to your levels of performance!",

So, which student will do better in an exam?\n\n\n\tStudent 1 does 15 hours’ revision – All of it reading and making notes.\n\n\n\tStudent 2 only does 10 hours’ revision – Two hours making mind-maps, two hours creating flash cards of key terms, three hours writing timed essays, two hours working through past papers and looking for patterns in the questions asked, and half an hour doing the hardest question they could find, followed by half an hour talking it through with their teacher. Then they spend five hours out with their friends and watching TV\n\nThe second student will perform better, despite revising for fewer hours!\n\nNow try our Revision Questionnaire in the link below, remembering to make a note of your scores.\n\nVESPA REVISION QUESTIONNAIRE\n\n\nWhen you have taken the questionnaire will notice that the revision activities have been placed into 3 categories:\n\n\n\tContent Techniques\n\tSkill Techniques\n\tFeedback Techniques\n\nNotice in our example that student 1 only does content revision, while student 2 does all three stages and then takes some time off. In our experience, student 2 will pretty much always get a better grade than student 1. And they put in fewer hours.\n\nMake sure you do some revision for each of C, S and F! Aim for three of each; nine methods in total.\n\nWe’ve found that students who get the best results practise in a wider variety of ways. Our top performers had over ten ticks in the always column, and these were evenly spread across C, S and F. However, students who worse results had far fewer ticks in the always column – often only four or five. They were very restricted in the way they practised, often spending hours repeating the same limited range of activities.\nAim to increase the ticks in your always column to ten.\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsThe following is a list of practice strategies suggested by John Dunlosky, a professor at Kent State University in the United States. Dunlosky and colleagues (2013) carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate ten popular learning techniques and their effectiveness. (We’ve adjusted his language to make it more accessible in the table below.)\nThe tasks towards the top of the table had the largest impact on learning and the tasks at the bottom had the smallest.

Whether you’re taking three or four A level courses, applying to university, organising some work shadowing or completing an extended project qualification, the number of projects you’re running at the same time can feel overwhelming. Don’t worry. This is normal.\nThe Project Progress Chart activity helps you track where you are with each one.\nThe Picture below shows an example of a \"Project Progress Chart\"\nList every job or task you’ve got to do and place them somewhere on the grid. It will help you prioritise what to do next.\n\n\n\tThe Horizontal axis shows TIME- Projects ahead of schedule go far right and projects lagging behind go far left. \n\tThe Vertical axis is QUALITY - Projects heading for a high quality finish go at the top and projects that are running on a low quality go towards the bottom.\nGood project management tools tell you where to start when you’re feeling overwhelmed – anywhere in the bottom left is a good place to begin. Don’t feel guilty about stealing time from projects in the top right quadrant. If they’re ahead of schedule you can afford to shift a little of your time and attention to a project that needs work.\n\nTHINK 🤔Final ThoughtsTake any task in the behind schedule/low quality quadrant – that’s the bottom left one – and attach the length of time it would take to complete. Now go to your diary/planner and block out a period of time when you can make significant progress on this task.\nWe’ve also seen students use this grid to prioritise a single subject. They list every single one of the topics they need to revise, then place them on the matrix. The topics that end up in the bottom left are the ones they know they need to focus on first.\nThe example below was from one of our students, we thought it might help.",

This is crucial: how big is the job ahead of you? Surprisingly, lots of students never really get to grips with what they need to know.\n\tSecond is the TIME FRAME - You need to consider two things here: when is the deadline for the project, and how many hours will you need to complete it? Thinking in terms of hours will give you a much clearer idea when it comes to scheduling the project.\n\tThird is QUALITY - Not only do you have to consider the standards you want to achieve, but you also need to know the criteria you are working towards. What exactly do you have to do to meet the standards? Write these down in this box.\n\tFinally, RESOURCES - this is a list of everything you will need to complete the project. Which can also include people – for example, you might have to meet certain teachers to discuss the requirements of the exam.\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsOnce you’ve completed the STQR, take a photo on your phone, so that you can review your progress.

In other words, the job that has the largest number of positive knock-on effects.\nWhen you’ve got a list of things to do, use this principle to guide where you put your effort.

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nThis is a simple system of time management. It’s based on the idea of a long-term project being like a bridge.\nImagine a bridge built over a wide valley. What kind of bridge are you imagining? We would bet it has vertical piers holding it up. That’s because everyone knows that something which spans a long distance needs regular structure to support it.\nNow imagine that bridge as a long-term project – an essay that needs to be handed in to your teacher in two weeks or a coursework project that needs to be submitted in three months. The project is a long-term, long-distance project, so it needs a regular structure to support it. The 2–4–8 rule helps you build that solid structure, like vertical piers supporting a bridge.\n1. The Short-Term Project: ‘You’ve got two weeks to complete this’Many teachers might give you two weeks to complete a project. Here’s how to use the 2–4–8 rule to respond:\n\n\tTarget 1: Two days - Make a note of what you would like to achieve to get the project started – a side of writing, three hours of reading, some research, organising your notes or planning your piece. Set yourself a target of two days to complete this work.\n\tTarget 2: Four days later - Make a note of where you want to be four days after that. Halfway through would be a sensible plan. Break the back of the task – get through the hard bit.\n\tTarget 3: eight days later - You’re handing in the assignment today. It needs to be complete. Make sure you’ve finished early, gone through it and made any adjustments.\n2. The Long -Term Project: ‘This needs finishing by March’Often coursework submissions come with more extended deadlines like this. If your deadline is a longer one, it’s worth working backwards from targets like this:\n\n\tTarget 3: eight months until submission - In these early stages, you should be finding an example of what you’re trying to achieve – for example, another student’s coursework submission. Look it over and say to yourself, ‘I want mine to look like this.’ Make a list of what needs to be done by the end of the project. Get started on rough, early versions or drafts.\n\tTarget 2: four months until submission. - Make notes of where you would like to be halfway through assuming it’s going really well. By now you will have been working on early versions and fleshing them out.\n\t\n\t\tHow many sections will be complete in rough form by this point?\n\t\tWhat will your word count be (if it’s a written task)?\n\t\tWhat reading and research will you have done and incorporated by this point?\n\t\tWhat standard will you have achieved?\n\t\n\tTarget 1: Two months until submission - If you’ve met your targets up to this point, you’ll know very clearly what needs to be done to complete the project, and you can begin the final stages of the project in earnest.\n\t\n\t\tWhat groundwork do you still need to do?\n\t\tWhat reading needs to be completed?\n\t\tWhat notes do you still need to take and incorporate?\n\t\tHow many words are left?\n\t\tHow do you conclude and reference?\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsChunking large projects into smaller, more manageable tasks makes you feel less daunted bout starting the project.\nWhat projects are you currently working on that you could apply this strategy to?",

In other words, students do significantly better if they review their learning regularly rather than if they leave it to pile up, and then try to deal with it all at once. Your productivity – the amount of efficient and effective work you do – is significantly improved by doing the work frequently.Here’s a habit to work on developing. It’s called the Weekly Review. Follow these steps and you will find yourself snacking – checking your learning regularly – instead of bingeing.Set aside an hour a week. -  This time must be sacred – don’t let anyone disturb you! Put your phone on aeroplane mode, go offline and never swap your hour for something else or skip it. Make it a crucial part of your week. We suggest a Friday afternoon, a Sunday evening or a Monday morning.Split up the hour evenly. -  We suggest fifteen or twenty minutes per course. Be strict with yourself.For fifteen or twenty minutes, review the week’s work in that course. We suggest the following:Check your notes are clear, legible and in order.Summarise your learning in a quick diagram, graphic organiser, mind-map or a few lines of notes.Highlight or circle material you’ve found hard this week. This is the stuff you will need to work on during your independent study time. You might want to draw up a question or two you’d like to ask your teachers.Go through the jobs you’ve been given and the deadlines you’ve got. Make a prioritised list for the week ahead, perhaps using an activity like The Energy Line (page 48).Do this once for each subject -  you should now be feeling pretty good. You’re in control.\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsStudents who make a habit of the Weekly Review are often much calmer and less stressed. They can leave school on Friday knowing they’re on top of things. They’ve emptied their heads of all the little niggling worries that might keep them awake at night. Which subject needs to be the one you do most regular reviews of? Why?",

Not straightaway – it needs time to get up to speed. But then it hits a sweet spot when it’s really firing. Brain efficiency can vary, she says, but in the morning it can be up to 30% more active and sharp than it is at other times.\nHere’s something else to consider: the longer the day goes on, the more self-control problems you will have. If you’re trying to give up chocolate, for example, you will rarely crack at 10 a.m. But by 4.30 p.m., when you’re feeling tired, your self-control slips. It’s the same with work. If you tell yourself you will start a big project at 3 p.m. or 6 p.m., the chances of that happening are low. If you set aside some ‘breakfast club’ time – sweet spot time in the morning – you’re much more likely to clear the job.\nAnd yet we often see students using a morning study period to ease themselves into the day. They waste their moments of high brain energy on social media and gaming, then turn their attention to work later on when they’re not as productive.\nYour morning mood dictates how productive you will be for the rest of the day. Start everyday right with these proven morning routine tips!\n\nREFLECT 🤔\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhat went well and what needs adjusting as a result of your experiment?

And lists are good – they help you keep on top of what it is you’ve got to do.The drawback of a list is that it doesn’t tell you what to do first. A better tool to use for prioritising tasks is an Energy Line – it beats a to-do list any day of the week. Scott Belsky suggests this technique in his book Making Ideas Happen (2011). We love it! It helps you put things in order according to how much effort or energy you need to give them.\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsProject management tools like this often work because they tell us what our next one or two tasks are.\nEven when our to-do list seems huge and overwhelming, as long as we know what’s next, we’re often OK. It means we can ignore the big picture for a little while and just concentrate on the next thing on the energy line.\nConsider the following possibilities:\n\n\tAre you burying an important job lower down the line – one you really need to get done? What is the one item on the list that you’re dreading the most ... and is there a way you could get it started right now?\n\tCould you take a task you’re reluctant to start and replace it with three smaller jobs – the beginning, middle and end of the bigger task? You’ll have more jobs on your Energy Line, but they’ll each be easier to complete.\n\tTry estimating the time it would take to complete each item on your list and write this next to the task.Then add up all the tasks and see how much time you’ve predicted this will take in total.

      "background_content": "LEARNStanford University has a Persuasive Technology Lab. Here, academics study how interactive technology is changing our habits. Its founder and director, Dr B. J. Fogg, is studying how smartphone technology can develop habit formation. Effort is also a habit. The level of effort you put into your study is a result of your habits. Some people have got the effort habit, some people haven’t.\nThe argument goes that there are three elements to habit formation, often referred to as the three R’s:\n\n\tThe Reminder. This could be a feeling, a place or a time of day – it’s your body or brain giving you a trigger that initiates the behaviour. It might be getting some chocolate, going home early or putting away the work you know you should be completing.\n\tThe Routine. This is the behaviour itself. Going to the canteen and buying the chocolate or taking the bus home instead of staying on to do some studying. Often people will feel a twinge of guilt during the routine but do it anyway.\n\tThe Reward. This is the good feeling you get – the benefit you gain from engaging in the behaviour. It might not last long but it is a tempting prospect.\nIf you haven’t currently got into the effort habit, how can you go about changing? You can use the three R’s in your favour.\nRather than thinking about stopping old habits – which is a mistake many people make when ‘giving up’ something – the trick is to think of it as starting a new habit. This means you will need a new reminder to trigger your new habit, a new routine to go through and, best of all, a new reward to give yourself!\n\nREFLECTFinal ThoughtsIt is far easier to establish a new habit than it is to break an old one. When you plan a new habit, never use the negative language associated with breaking habits. Avoid ‘I must stop being lazy ...’ or ‘I’ve got to give up skipping homework ...’. Instead, use positive language. Try, ‘From Wednesday, I’m going to start working harder.’\nAllow yourself slips and mistakes. They happen to everyone. Successful students keep going even when they’ve broken a habit. One way to help with this is to give yourself one day a week when you don’t have to follow your new habit. Every Friday might be the day when you behave like the old you – what fitness fans or dieters sometimes refer to as a ‘cheat day’. Putting a cheat day into your schedule might help keep you motivated. Plus – you’re still following your new habit on the other six days and that might well keep you going for much longer.\nThe following link is an excellent blog explaining how to turn your habits into a lifestyle - How to turn habits into lifestyle\nOne of the tips on the site is the \"Habit Loop\", and to learn to trigger a habit by a cue. Learn what is triggering your current habits and try and change them. Add a reward to reinforce the new habit.\nResearch suggests that it takes 21 days to create the habit, and 90 days before the new habit is engrained as a new lifestyle. You have to commit to this!!",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡Professor Peter Gollwitzer of New York University says that many people who want to put their efforts into achieving great things, but don’t, are derailed by seemingly small problems like these:\n\n\tThey want to finish a task to a high standard, but a phone call disrupts them.\n\tThey want to complete a coursework piece, but the weekend is just too busy.\n\tThey want to do some serious revision, but some friends disturb them and the work is abandoned.\nIn their book The Psychology of Action (1996), Peter Gollwitzer and John Bargh argue that if this happens to you, it’s because you have low ‘implementation intention’ – you sort of want to put in the effort, but you will be easily put off if one thing goes wrong.\nThe solution? Successful students anticipate these problems and plan for how they will respond to them with maximum effort. You sequence actions that anticipate obstacles and build in pre-prepared solutions – you effectively beat self-sabotage before it even happens.\nConsider these examples:\nStudent 1: ‘I’ll get started on this first thing in the morning.’\nThis is a really common internal dialogue you might experience as a student – lots do it! And with one small disruption the whole plan comes to a standstill.\nStudent 2: ‘I’ll get started on this first thing in the morning. And ...\n\n\tIf I wake up late by accident, then I’ll use my morning break to start it instead and ...’\n\tIf I feel really demotivated, then I’ll get two coffees from the canteen and drink them quickly to give me a boost and ...’\n\tIf I get disturbed by friends, then I’ll make an excuse and go to the library and ...’\n\tIf the internet is down, then I’ll start by using my class notes and save the research work until later.’\nIt’s easy to see which student might be the one most likely to succeed. Student 2 has listed a series of potential problems and has recognised their tendency to self-sabotage when small things go wrong. By planning a change in action when those small obstacles come along, they are much more likely to keep pushing forward.\nList all the usual blockers you use to prevent high levels of effort and for each one commit to a solution.\nThink them all through in your head and make notes. What you are doing is strengthening your implementation intention. You will put the effort in, even if small things crop up to stop you.\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsIf ... then planning often starts quite deliberately, with students using a grid like the one above to record their intentions. This keeps them firmly in mind when obstacles come.\nBut after a little while, you’ll become good at internalising this kind of planning. You won’t have to write it all down – you’ll start doing it more instinctively. That’s a great place to be.",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡In \"Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives (2015)\", Gretchen Rubin, a lawyer and writer, says that the language we use to describe ourselves – our ‘inner storytelling’ – massively influences the amount of effort we put into a project.Rubin argues that ‘we tend to believe what we hear ourselves say, and the way we describe ourselves influences our view of identity’ (2015, p. 225). Perhaps this describes you – maybe you’ve told yourself these stories for years. Inner storytelling helps us live up to our own hopes and fears.\nThis activity lasts for one week, during which time your challenge is to change your inner storytelling. This, in turn, could change your patterns of behaviour, your habits and, ultimately, the effort you put into your work.\nA good place to start would be to choose one of the following stories to tell about yourself:\n\n\tWhen I started my Level 3 course(s), I suddenly became a hard-worker. I battle.\n\tI give 100% whatever I do. I never give up.\n\tWhen I say I’ll do something, I do it.\n\tI’ll deliver. I always do.\n\tI don’t waste time. I get things done.\n\tI’m dedicated and strong under pressure. People can rely on me.\n\tWhen there is a challenging task, I go at it until I’m done.\n\tI’m not lazy or flaky. I’m no shirker.\nResearch conducted by Ethan Kross, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, shows that self-talk like this works even better in the second or third person (using the pronoun ‘you’ or your first name instead of ‘I’) so you might want to experiment with your language (Kross et al., 2014). Once you’ve chosen your new story, you need to find a method of verbalising it. The word ‘mantra’ is often used to describe an utterance or phrase with psychological power. This is what you’re creating here. Find a time of day when you can repeat your mantra – on the bus, in the shower, walking home or crossing the campus between lessons. Then try it for a week.\nExample Mantra:\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsNow Display your Mantra.It is a good idea to put your mantra up on your wall, or as a screensaver on your phone. Somewhere where you will be constantly reminded of what you are trying to achieve.",

      "background_content": "LEARNThis activity focuses on the separate advice of two academics. The ‘frogs’ part of this advice comes from time management guru Brian Tracy, who in Eat That Frog! (2013) asks his readers to imagine that tasks are frogs you have to eat. He chooses this metaphor because the thought of such tasks is often very off-putting. His advice is as follows:\n‘If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first’ (p.2).\nThis is another way of saying that if you have important tasks to apply your effort to, start with the biggest, hardest and most important one first. This is related to Tim Ferriss’ idea of the ‘lead domino’ (which he talks about in his podcast ‘How to Build a Large Audience From Scratch (And More)’. If you do the tough tasks first, your effort will be worthwhile because it will pay dividends later. So, list all your frog tasks – in order of ugliness!\nThe ‘banisters’ part comes from computer science professor Randy Pausch. ‘It doesn’t matter how well you polish the underside of the banister,’ says Pausch (2010, p. 108). In other words, don’t worry about unimportant details – put your effort where the result will be greatest.\n\nREFLECT\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRidding of ourselves of the jobs that are not necessary can help us remove unnecessary stress from our lives.Also, completing a hard task we have been avoiding can gives us a real boost of pride, and relief.  It can help us believe anything is possible!!",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡A ‘blocker’ is a psychological barrier that stops you working. It might be a pattern of thinking or a habit you’ve established that you can’t break. All of us have blockers – thoughts and feelings that stop us doing the thing we know we really need to do.To put in the effort for Level 3 success you have to recognise your blockers and break down those patterns of thought. This four stage model is useful for recognising the behaviours and thought patterns that are a sign of blockers.1. Initial Lack of MotivationEveryone feels discouraged at some point – the feeling that they don’t want to complete a piece of work, finish an essay or put in a couple of hours on a tricky piece of coursework. The difference is what you tend to do next.2. Bypassing ConscienceMost people will feel guilty when they don’t work (‘I should be finishing that essay …’), but sometimes we find ways of bypassing our conscience. We deliberately rethink the situation until we feel better about it.Some thought patterns you might have include:Student A hasn’t done it either, so I’m not that bad.At other schools/colleges they don’t even do this piece, so why should I?The instructions were unclear, so I’ve got an excuse. I’m telling myself I didn’t really understand.I rushed a piece last time and the grade was OK. I’ll do that again.I deserve a break. I’ve always really loved this TV programme – I’ll watch it instead.I’m going to do something else that has some ‘educational value’.3. Creating An OpportunityNext, there needs to be something nearby that can distract you. Some students work near others and tell themselves this is beneficial because they can ask for help if they need it. What they might actually be doing is hoping for a distraction to occur. The same goes for workspaces.Do you work near or next to your phone, laptop, tablet, PS4 console or TV, secretly hoping for something to take you away from your work?If this is you, then you are subconsciously (or maybe deliberately!) creating the opportunity for blocks to occur.4. Getting Away With ItFinally, for the pattern to continue, you need to feel that you have got away with it. The thought pattern here often goes, ‘Nobody said anything, so it must be alright’ or ‘I didn’t get told off, so I’ll do it again.’This activity might help you recognise your own tendency to self-sabotage. Don’t worry, everyone does it to a certain extent – really productive people have learned to fight the feeling!\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsEveryone has blockers – and everyone occasionally sabotages their own progress. The key is to recognise you’re doing it, and to fight it! \nIf you feel self-sabotage coming on, move location. Get yourself to a quiet room, a study area or the library. Start the task. You don’t even have to finish it – work for thirty minutes or so – but get it started. You’re less likely to sabotage a project that is already underway!",

      "background_content": "LEARN 💡\nLook back at the work you’ve done so far this term and think about the levels of effort you’ve put in to your studies. Use the scale below and the following guideline to choose your current effort number:\n\n\n\t1 - Little or no effort.\n\t5 - Some effort – you’re working quite hard.\n\t10 - High levels of effort – the hardest you’ve worked. Be honest with yourself, choose your number and record it in the box.\nWhat Are Other Students Doing?The problem with making a judgement about your own levels of effort is that scales can be subjective.Here are some of the issues:\n\n\tThe numbers mean different things to different people.\n\tStudents tend to surround themselves with people who do either similar or less work than they do. This means they ‘normalise’ the amount of work they are doing, even feel good about it, because they can point to someone doing less than they are.\n\tStudents don’t have a clear idea of what the hardest working students are doing.\n\tNo one can know what students are doing in other schools and colleges. The answer is to get some concrete figures so the choice of number is a more accurate reflection of your levels of effort relative to other students.\nThe following activity is about you re-evaluating your current level of effort using an objective scale, rather than just guessing how much effort you are making.\n\nREFLECT 🤔Final ThoughtsIt’s unlikely your teachers will be setting you work that will total twenty or thirty hours. The key to reaching\nthis level is to set yourself independent study tasks. It might sound crazy but this is what the high effort\nstudents we’ve met and interviewed tell us they do. Here are a few examples of these activities:\n\n\tHanding in homework early to get extra feedback.\n\tRescuing a project that’s behind schedule.\n\tAsking a teacher five questions to help clarify a problem.\n\tSeeking a book/study guide recommendation. \n\tCompleting a one-hour reread and reorganise of notes on a topic.\n\tSending five emails asking for support, help or advice.\n\tTalking through a topic with another student.\n\tBorrowing someone else’s notes.\n\tAttending a support class or revision session.\n\tHanding in an edited piece of work. \n\tReviewing a teacher’s feedback to look for patterns.\n\tTidying resources and summarising a topic on one sheet of A4. \nYou could choose a couple of these to get you started. Just remember one final thing: don’t fall for the myth of the brilliant, talented student who does superbly in every test without putting any effort in. We’ve never known it to be true – and we’ve worked with thousands of students. The ones with the best grades always turn out to be doing the most independent work!",

In her book, Rethinking Positive Thinking (2014), Gabrielle Oettingen argues that too much positive visualisation can rob a person of their desire to succeed – they get happy enough just dreaming about something and never end up doing it.\n\nAny goal you set will usually have obstacles in the way of you achieving them (if they were easy everyone would be able to achieve them!). It’s tempting to think that your obstacles will mainly come from outside of you: changing jobs markets, your parents splitting up, friendships ending, etc.\n\nThese things happen, of course, but most of the obstacles you will face will come from within yourself. The phrase ‘self-sabotage’ is often used to describe how we end up becoming the obstacle to our own aims because of the ways in which we think or behave.\n\nCheck out the video to understsand more about the technique owe use in this activity to reframe your thinking:\n\nREFLECT",

Most people have long lists of both dreams and goals and it’s easy to mix them up. But it’s important to recognise that dreams are unlikely to happen. Instead we use them to provide comfort when times are difficult. Goals are different – there’s a good chance of achieving them because each day, week or month we take action towards them. Here is a good way of distinguishing between your dreams and your goals.\n\nREFLECT",

But there are questions that work. The questions in this activity have been tested over and over again with students and seem to be ones that are more likely to open up some positive thinking. They’re not very direct and some will look strange, but give them your time – we’ve found that students who can reflect on their vision often learn to know themselves better.\n\nREFLECT",
